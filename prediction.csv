"1.) The movie cited source, “Vaxxed”, written Andrew Wakefield. He former UK doctor hired group parents find link vaccines autism.

His first, believe only, article retracted Lancet years publication. Wakefield stripped medical license ability continue practicing medicine UK. No doctors, country, ever completed study replicated results. An important factor scientific studies need repeatable. If nobody else getting results, study suspect regardless ethics (but that's huge deal anyways) would HIGHLY skeptical anything name it. 2.) The movie Vaxxed showing one “side” story, call that. It's meant scare people convince vaccines bad. It sound source heavily biased not present information, information supports narrative. 3.) Vaccine injuries real thing. However, also incredibly rare. not doctor, medical professional capacity, hard science you. But look number people fully vaccinated compare number people vaccine caused injuries. My entire life, 99% people know fully vaccinated, not single one impairment attributed vaccines. I'd research actual chances vaccine injury. But I'm almost positive chances vaccine injury significantly smaller chances injury routine necessary/life saving procedures bat eye (think surgeries like) 4.) The hole logic anti-Vaxxers I've never heard answer this: break arm, going go? Answer: doctor's. They think twice it. know anti-vaxxers rushed children doctor high fever. However, also claim big pharma conspiracy trying hurt you. If vaccines safe, anything doctor says/does trusted? Either conspiracy dumb enough taken it, either way trust them? Also, FDA approves vaccines, also approve meds might take/a doctor might prescribe you. How trust ANY vaccines huge conspiracy? You're better staying away entirely that's case. 5.) The ingredients vaccines sound scary, sure. trust mix vaccine safely. However, not doctor. spend years studying medicine, following strict procedures countless peer-reviewed tested studies know-how make vaccines. Just like trust wire house, no experience, would trust electrician. Or would trust cardiologist perform open heart surgery trust husband medical professional. 6.) On whole “ingestion vs injection” thing; broccoli totally safe ingest. We recommend people ingestion broccoli good you. We not recommend people injecting broccoli bloodstream. Again, I'm not doctor, injecting broccoli body kill you. Should get rid broccoli? 7.) Vaccines seem unnecessary, work. Vaccines stop spread dangerous even deadly diseases. When enough people vaccinate, protects vulnerable populations (elderly, young, immunocompromised, one reason another cannot receive vaccines). The disease cannot spread, causing effectively die out, least prevents becoming pandemic. This whole Coronavirus thing actually good illustration bad pandemic beneficial vaccines are. Smallpox, measles, heck even flu, used tear communities kill/injure lot people. Modern medicine helps, vaccines keep spreading like wildfire first place. When last measles epidemic?

">Claiming industry-funded studies biased. This simply not true https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20614424. When citing studies, make sure major conflicts interest ***IMPORTANT*** This NOT date evidence flu vaccine's effectiveness, cited source fact industry-funded studies biased. Here date reviews: This remotely line FDA approval standards. also see Cochrane review way justifies opinion unless misunderstand 'bias' meant reviews. Edit: So missed likely referring link, warning bottom (and this) Cochrane review. This review no particular issue statement industry funded studies and, course, included many. The actual study trying refer [this one](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.b354) another study author Cochrane reviews cited. Notably reviews line reported influenza vaccine efficacy common, ~45%. I've taken one example 2009 review meant cite example (see Wongsurakiat 2004 Table 2): >>Study conducted one year. Conclusions support recommendation annual vaccination (one dose sufficient adults, strong response observed). Authors note vaccine effectiveness shown, even possibly administered late (in region study carried peak incidence influenza occurs usually May). All totally line results. They strong evidence effect even later administration. Seasonal homogeneity uncommon, bizarre complaint strong statistical results completely 'concordant' summary conclusion. In fact, delayed administration first dose still effective totally line rapid waning influenza vaccine efficacy. Plus patients second booster dose not normally recommended adults, maintaining higher titer levels next season. On cynical reading, one might think patients sick May included even though vaccination began June. In reality, given study conducted full calendar year simply rolled month 'normal peak' season, means vaccination began June 1997, included May 1998 (peak season) went October 1998. >>Comment: though authors state effectiveness shown influenza related ARI only, not influenza, recommend vaccination patients COPD. Because demonstrated statistically significant reduction influenza related ARI or, referred study, ILI. >>This means recommending vaccine though not effective influenza acute exacerbations. Misleading incorrect wording. The Cochrane authors distinguishing ILI laboratory confirmed influenza virus infection (causing pathology 'influenza'). As original authors state, viral propagation infection possible 10% patients ILI presentation. The paper *not* demonstrate *lack* efficacy, *fails* demonstrate *presence* efficacy lab confirmed influenza. Yet considering serology confirmed increase antibody titer, strong reduction ILI, lack effect non-influenza ARI, terrible mischaracterization study conclusions. Usually no ability distinguish flu-ARI non-flu-ARI. However case viral agents confirmed, giving much higher confidence proper ILI designation. >>In addition, lack comment community viral circulation vaccine content matching make verification effectiveness ARI impossible. no idea Cochrane authors saying here. Wongsurakiat et al *do* comment circulating virus among community, *do* comment vaccine content, *do* make matching verification. The predominantly circulating type flu H3N2 time, vaccine component stated target, majority confirmed flu study confirmed type A. moreover, confirm specific titer increases study subjects line well-known protective level thresholds. And, finally, authors *don't* suggest vaccine effect ARI--that say acute respiratory infections--and instead say true *only* influenza-ARI. This prime example table discordance...I'm extremely disappointed. The Cochrane authors seem dispute sensitive nature COPD patients airway exacerbations wholly ignore supreme risk factor responsible clinician must weigh (risk) perceived benefit vaccine (reward). See excerpt: >>All unvaccinated patients moderate-to-severe COPD hospitalized influenzarelated ARI required mechanical ventilation. One patients severe COPD died ventilator-associated pneumonia. In contrast, none vaccinated patients required mechanical ventilatory support ARI related influenza virus infection. Now, results might not statistically significant, evidence ""not effective influenza acute exacerbations"" like Cochrane authors state. Are Cochrane authors *really* disputing idea influenza vaccination proved effective ILI? Or harping lack distinction ILI lab-confirmed influenza? Because one questions obvious practical answer clinicians, academic philosophical exercise. I'm either missing something big, huge oversight part Cochrane authors. Cochrane authors humans study authors. To conclude industry funded studies completely unreliable not 'concordant' Cochrane authors themselves.",positive,0.2486161,negative

And insert actually lists pneumonia possible side effect. Cochrane review https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/22895945/ And... The Myth Herd Immunity The Myth Herd Immunity leads us believe unvaccinated populations bring back epidemics deadly diseases. This myth also makes us believe that: 1. Unvaccinated children threat society 2. Unvaccinated children pose risk vaccinated children. I'll tackle whole discombobulated mess myth one post, research, knowledge, science, expertise doctor, pediatrician, neurosurgeon. What told? We often hear statements public health officials like “Clusters unvaccinated children not potential danger themselves, also threat herd immunity”. Authorities argue parents vaccinate children protect society whole epidemics. According public health officials, “parents reject vaccines consider effect child rest society”. We told shots work, everyone must play along. And parents decline vaccines, somehow reaping benefits vaccinated. What truth? Dr. O'Shea, book: “Vaccination Not Immunization” explains: “Do not make error many pediatricians journalists talk herd immunity though refers immunity proceeds large group people vaccinated. The calculated deception behind common misnomer know herd immunity is, buy illusion: unvaccinated child take advantage herd vaccinated. This well though-out propaganda. True herd immunity term indicates disease burned within population, plague, smallpox, typhus-every infectious disease history. The herd become immune. Natural selection. It nature, not manmade vaccines. Don't fooled again” Dr. Palevsky (board-certified pediatrician) explains: “This whole concept herd immunity interesting, taught herd immunity occurs certain percentage population gets active illness. Therefore certain percentage getting active illness, impart protection onto remaining part population not gotten illness yet. And herd getting illness shedding illness protecting not gotten it."" In vaccine science, extrapolating concluding vaccinate certain percentage people, imparting protection not vaccinated. And NOT shown true, true herd immunity theory based ACTIVE DISEASE, know despite we're taught, vaccination not mimic natural disease. Thus, cannot use model herd immunity natural disease vaccination policy. This not stop press, every single year. The entire concept herd immunity fails acknowledge life cycle viruses bacteria own, turns may nothing percentage people infected. By failing include viruses life cycle, relationship organisms us, missing main point. It preposterous think child vaccinated no longer carries bacteria viruses vaccinated against. That whole point vaccines. So Once You Are Vaccinated, You Are Part Herd. Right? Dr. Blaylock (board certified neurosurgeon) explains: “In original description herd immunity, protection population large occurred people contracted infections naturally. The reason naturally acquired immunity lasts lifetime. Vaccine proponents quickly latched onto concept applied vaccine-induced immunity. But one major problem: Vaccine-induced immunity lasts relatively short period… This quietly began suggest boosters vaccines, even common childhood infections chickenpox, measles, mumps, rubella. Then discovered even greater problem: The boosters lasting two years less. This seeing mandates youth entering colleges multiple vaccines, even insisted gave lifelong immunity, MMR. The suggested full-grown adults. Ironically, no one media medical field asking going on. They accept must done. That vaccine-induced herd immunity mostly myth proven quite simply. We told 70 years vaccine immunity lasts lifetime. It not relatively recently discovered vaccines lost effectiveness 10 years given. What means least half population, baby boomers, no vaccine-induced immunity diseases vaccinated early life. At least 50 percent population unprotected decades. If listen present-day wisdom, risk resurgent massive epidemics vaccination rate fall 95 percent. Yet lived least 30 40 years 50 percent less population vaccine protection. Herd immunity not existed country many decades, no resurgent epidemics occurred. Vaccine-induced herd immunity lie used frighten doctors, public-health officials, medical personnel, public accepting vaccinations”. Where Logic? Take Pertussis (whooping cough) Dr. Palevsky explains well: Do children vaccinated pertussis vaccine somehow stop carrying pertussis bacteria airways simply they've vaccinated? NO Do pertussis vaccines stop vaccinated children transmitting pertussis bacteria people? NO Do pertussis bacteria disappear society vaccination rates high? NO: Vaccination rates pertussis no impact whether pertussis bacteria air not, whether not breathe in. The presence pertussis bacteria, exposure them, no way affected vaccination status vaccination rates. Do unvaccinated children, unvaccinated, carry bacteria airways, vaccinated children somehow no longer believed carrying they've vaccinated? NO Do unvaccinated children transmit pertussis bacteria children mere fact not vaccinated? NO: Air air. Air free breathe. We breathe whatever air. And, vaccinated unvaccinated children equally exposed breathing pertussis bacteria. Anyone poses science idea unvaccinated children pose threat population unvaccinated likely transmit disease rest population, misleading you, promulgating myth, inaccurate. Vaccination pertussis vaccine not exonerate anyone carrying pertussis bacteria, prevent exposed bacteria. Unvaccinated children not walk around carrying secret viruses bacteria no-one else has.
