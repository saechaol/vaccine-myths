We obviously don't worry about the elements that make up what goes on or in most of our foods, why are you making a fuss about thimerasol?

You could go get 40 vaccines at once and still receive less \"mercury\" than you would eating fish, and fish contains methylmercury, which is actually harmful. \n\nEven if we humored your ridiculous idea that the mercury in thimerasol is actually worrisome, which it isn't because thimerasol still isn't mercury, you should worry more about literally everything else because of the minuscule amounts of it.

Guess what? That incredibly tiny amount of ethyl organomercury is processed by this system extremely easily and is removed from the body. \n\nSo, Dr. Dumbass, do you want to keep going on about the total NON-FUCKING-ISSUE of thimerosal and how it ISN'T FUCKING MERCURY, or do you want to continue to be a total idiot? \n\nJesus fucking Christ, dude, you might as well be against vaccines because you sure as shit aren't for the truth.\n\nAlso, go get a flu shot and come back and tell me if there's a question on the form you filled out about being allergic to thimerosal. They don't exactly hide it. 1. It's an ingredient in a shot which has a thimerasol free version and 2. Unless your body personally has a problem with it, it's not harmful. \n\nFuck. ",

I thought you were the other poster who is an antivaxxer. I provided a general resource debunking the core pillars of antivaxxer nonsense. And, to be clear, OP and the conspiracy squad have mentioned autism. So it is directly relevant to the overall discussion, just maybe not to you. \n\nI don't know why you find this is so bothersome. If you want to know what's in it, read it. If you like it, save it. If you don't find it useful, don't worry about it. Repeat as necessary. As far as I'm concerned, there's no reason to mention it further.\n\n---\n\n>Here is an explanation of how I calculated the measles death rate (including the 1 in 250 estimate) \n\nGreat, let's break that down.\n\n>CDC lists a death rate up to 1 in 500, but mentions that before the vaccine there were thought to be 3-4 million cases and 500 deaths each year, which would be a 1 in 6,000-8,000 death rate \n\nThere are three incongruous parts meshed together with one bad assumption:\n\n1) The mortality rate of measles is \"up to 1:500\"\n\n2) Pre-1963, there were an estimated 3-4 million cases of measles annually\n\n3) Pre-1963, there were 500 deaths annually\n\nFor the third point, this is, according to the CDC source, from reported measles deaths. This is not an estimate, it is an average value of actual, reported cases. This is true for pre-1963 era.\n\nFor the second, this is an estimate of the total measles morbidity annually prior to 1963. This is probably accurate for pre-1963 era, but comes loaded with a 25-33% error range, not including a particular confidence interval. \n\nFor the first, the mortality rate is based on data from both before 1963 and after. This is derived from confirmed measles cases and confirmed measles deaths. Nuance is lost in the first point since you've lost the range, which is 1-2 per 1000. Additionally, this value is reported in an intuitive way (X per 1000) rather than the more scientifically meaningful way, a decimal number (2.0 per 1000; 0.63 per 1000). You can make the denominator increase or decrease 'large' amounts for relatively small movements in actual case fatality rates and with no or little meaningful statistical resolution between the two. \n\nAnd to belabor the point I've already made, you are comparing **estimated** morbidity with **known** mortality. That is apples to oranges. If you had an estimate of morbidity with an estimate of mortality, you could have at it. What's interesting, then, is that to get your 1:250 number you compare **known** cases with **known** mortality, not estimates. And this is further massaged by picking, presumably arbitrarily, 1994-2014. If we, also arbitrarily, include up to 1988 then we get a CFR of 0.0022 or roughly 1:450. If we just look at the outbreak of 1989-1991 we also get a CFR of 0.0022. If we just take the first five years of reported values starting at 1950--which has a combined 40 times case numbers than the entirety of 1988 onward--we get a CFR of 0.001 or roughly 1:970. Which rounds out a nice estimate of 0.001-0.002 or 1-2 per 1000. \n\nAnd yet in the first paragraph you have picked a *single range*--with no mind for data collection, statistical confidence, attack rate by age, or other extrapolation issues--while ignoring the repeatedly collected and congruent information which suggests this homebrewed estimate is wrong or not informative as packaged. \n\nBut I appreciate you explaining how you calculated it. Vaxfact seems like a very dubious website, as an aside. I would like to repeat my caution that you stick to reputable sources.\n\n\n\n",

McNall.\n\n[Identification of Measles Virus Vaccine Genotype](https://jcm.asm.org/content/55/3/735)\n\nMcNall wrote, \"During the measles outbreak in California in 2015, a large number of suspected cases occurred in recent vaccinees. Of the 194 measles virus sequences obtained in the United States in 2015, 73 were identified as vaccine sequences.\" This proves that the measles outbreak was in part caused by the vaccine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Vaccine  strain isn't the same as the pathogenic strain. This isn't scary for anyone except those undergoing chemotherapy and other immune-depleting  situations.\n\nMcNall contradicts that by explaining that vaccine strain reaction (rash & fever) is clinically indistinguishable from the natural disease. You need genotyping to confirm the origin and distinguish vaccine strain cases from wild-type cases.\n\nSo by you saying that vaccine strain measles is only scary for the immunocompromised, and CDC stating that the reaction of vaccine strain and wild strain is identical, it proves that the general public should NOT be worried about measles. It is a mild illness to everyone but, as you said, \"those undergoing chemotherapy and other immune-depleting  situations.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, thank you for showing me the 2004 Thimerosal study. You've uncovered something interesting.\n\nThe 1999 study is titled *Increased Risk of developmental neurologic impairment after high exposure to thimerosal-containing vaccine in first month of life.* It states children who received the Hep B at birth had an increase of 762% for autism, 498% for sleep disorders, and 206% for speech delays compared to children that did not receive the vaccine.\n\nThe conclusion: This analysis suggests that high exposure to ethylmercury from thimerosal-containing vaccines in the first month of life increases the risk of subsequent development of neurologic development impairment...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOddly, the 2004 continuation study is the exact opposite. Titled *Safety of Thimerosal-Containing Vaccines: A Two-Phased Study of Computerized Health Maintenance Organization Databases.*\n\nIn this \"Phase II\" study, they've re-analyzed the Phase I data and suddenly found no increased risks for autism or attention-deficit disorder.\n\n*Conclusions.* No  consistent significant associations were found between TCVs and neurodevelopmental outcomes. **Conflicting results were found at different  HMOs for certain outcomes. For resolving the conflicting findings,  studies with uniform neurodevelopmental assessments of children with a  range of cumulative thimerosal exposures are needed.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a feeling that you regard everything the CDC reports as unquestionably true. But even you might find this a bit sketchy:\n\n\\- In 1997, Congress mandated the FDA to complete a review of mercury in drugs and food.\n\n\\- In 1999, CDC conducted their study, found incredibly concerning data, and instead of making it public, they decided not to publish.\n\n\\- In 2001, the CDC removed or reduced thimerosal in all childhood vaccines because of safety concerns.\n\n\\- In 2004, they published the continuation study that suddenly found that thimerosal was safe all along. And to resolve this obvious conflict in data between Phase I & II, they suggested that more studies of children exposed to thimerosal were needed. Conveniently, thimerosal had already been removed...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

   "body": "A propósito de los comentarios que he leído y escuchado sobre las vacunas para el COVID19, pero sobre todo de la vacuna rusa Sputnik V, me he dado a la tarea de estudiar algunos textos científicos y hacer una compilación de los mismos para hacerlos de su conocimiento, a continuación les comparto\n\n**SOBRE LA VACUNA RUSA SPUTNIK V**  \nThe Lancet, una de las revistas médicas más prestigiosas del mundo, publicó los resultados de los ensayos de la primera y la segunda fase de la vacuna rusa SPUTNIK V, que demostraron lo siguiente:\n\n1. La plataforma de vectores adenovirales humanos es eficaz, a pesar de las preocupaciones por la posibilidad de una inmunidad preexistente a los adenovirus.\n\n2. Se seleccionó la dosis segura óptima que permitió lograr una respuesta inmunitaria humoral y celular en el 100 % de los participantes, incluso en aquellos que habían tenido una infección con adenovirus.\n\n3. El uso de dos vectores diferentes permite lograr una respuesta inmune más efectiva.\n\n4. El nivel de anticuerpos contra el SARS-CoV-2 en voluntarios vacunados con Sputnik V fue entre 1,4 y 1,5 veces más alto que el nivel de anticuerpos en los pacientes que se habían recuperado del covid-19.\n\n5. Tiene una eficacia de 91.4 por ciento contra el virus SARS-CoV-2, y de 100 por ciento para evitar los cuadros graves de la enfermedad Covid-19.\n\nAl mismo tiempo, no se encontraron eventos adversos graves en los vacunados con Sputnik V, mientras que para otras vacunas, este parámetro oscila entre el 1 y el 25 por ciento.\n\nVarias otras empresas están utilizando también plataformas basadas en vectores adenovirales humanos para sus vacunas contra el covid-19, como por ejemplo Johnson & Johnson, que usa el vector Ad26, y la china CanSino, que emplea el Ad5 mientras que la Rusa SPUTNIK V utiliza dos vectores adenovirales, el Ad5 y el Ad26.\n\nVale la pena mencionar que las plataformas para vacunas que usan otros países, como el vector de adenovirus de chimpancé (OXFORD-ASTRA ZENECA, quienes por cierto están estudiando la posibilidad de aplicar de manera conjunta su vacuna y la SPUTNIK V para incrementar su efectividad) o la tecnología de ARN (PFIZER-BIONTECH), nunca antes habían sido utilizadas en vacunas que hayan pasado la FASE 3. Tampoco han sido sometidas a estudios a largo plazo sobre sus posibles efectos secundarios en el cuerpo humano, como por ejemplo los riesgos de desarrollar complicaciones relacionadas con el cáncer o sus efectos sobre la fertilidad.\n\n**Las vacunas de ARN mensajero (PFIZER-BIONTECH-MODERNA).**  \nLa mayor preocupación con este tipo de vacunas ha sido su inestabilidad, su baja eficiencia para introducirlas en las células y que expresen el antígeno. También ha preocupado el hecho de que el ARN puede estimular reacciones inmunológicas de tipo inflamatorio, por lo que todos estos factores han limitado en parte su desarrollo. El ARN es una molécula muy inestable que requiere condiciones de mantenimiento extremas (de menos 80℃), se degrada muy fácilmente por enzimas y no se internaliza de forma eficiente.\n\nSin embargo, esta tecnología también tiene ventajas. Es relativamente más barata que otro tipo de vacunas y, sobre todo, permite diseñar una vacuna nueva en un tiempo récord. Una vez que se conoce el genoma del patógeno, en unas semanas se pueden producir los primeros prototipos vacunales, lo que la convierte en una excelente herramienta cuando aparece un patógeno nuevo para el que se necesita una vacuna con urgencia, como en una pandemia. En este caso, la rapidez es un beneficio mayor que el problema de su inestabilidad. Moderna fue capaz de diseñar su vacuna de ARNm contra SARS-CoV-2 tan solo seis semanas después de que el genoma del virus se hiciera público.\n\n**MI OPINIÓN.**  \nPor un lado la vacuna rusa aprovecha los modelos de vacunas ya probados, innova en el sentido de usar dos vectores en lugar de uno solo. Es un modelo que, si bien no tiene la efectividad que manifiestan en las vacunas de ARN mensajero, es más segura en términos de efectos secundarios adversos e igual de efectiva que la vacunas que todos conocemos hasta ahora y que nos hemos aplicado.\n\nPor el otro lado Pfizer y otras le apuestan al futuro y a lo económico, puede que en esta ocasión tengan tropezones pero el avance que van a lograr es un ahorro en años de investigación, aún así, como el resto de las vacunas, el reto será que en el mediano y largo plazo resulten eficaces y que sus efectos adversos sean mínimos para poder compararlas con el modelo tradicional de vacunas que, guste o no a políticos y villamelones, es eficaz y seguro.\n\n**¿CONCLUSIÓN?**  \nMe encuentro optimista, las vacunas contra el COVID19 comentadas en este texto han demostrado científicamente que podemos seguir confiando en la ciencia para resolver y prevenir problemas de salud como las pandemias. La competencia entre científicos es sana y provoca desarrollos alternativos, lo que nos permite tener varias respuestas a un mismo problema y con ello se abran posibilidades para tomar decisiones que, de acuerdo a cada país, pueden ser más adecuadas para cada uno.   \n\n¿Guerra fría en pleno siglo XXI?\n\nFUENTES.  \n1.

If an antivaxer is attacking you or making baseless/outlandish + unscientific claims, you can use this list of information to shut their arguments down immediately with facts:\n\n\\-**Vaccines are extremely safe**: in fact, *no serious adverse events* (besides injection site pain/erythema) have ever actually been proven.\n\n\\-Vaccine adverse events are notoriously **OVER** (not under!) reported. It is estimated by a Harvard study using data mining technology + VAERS reports that **adverse events are reported at 100x** (or more) the **rate that they actually occur.**\n\n\\-One study found that **97% of \"adverse events\"** from vaccines are actually **nocebo effects** (like the placebo effect, people believe/imagine they are having symptoms due to fear/expectation)\n\n\\-Not **a single case of autism** has ever made it to higher courts, because the **autism + vaccine connection has an overwhelming amount of research debunking it.**\n\n\\-in 1986, vaccine manufacturers took **on increased liability** for their product to reassure the public of safety: this is because research has proven without doubt that vaccines are **incredibly safe.** Despite manufacture liability, vaccine manufactures have never actually needed to pay out any amount for any purported \"injury\" claims. The evidence is overwhelming to **debunk these claims.**\n\n\\-**Andrew Wakefield,** a public disgrace and conspiracist theorist with multiple agendas, is the **only physician or scientist** to have **ever published a medical paper criticizing vaccine safety**. His paper was later **retracted for fraud** and his licence **revoked**.\n\n\\-**Vaccine inserts** list events that occur normally in populations and **do NOT prove any causative association** between vaccines and these purported \"events\". If the events listed in vaccine inserts actually \\*caused\\* these effects, billions in personal injury lawsuits would be paid out --> which is *not* the case!\n\n\\-Unlike what antivaxers claim, it has been proven thoroughly that Gardasil is incredibly safe. The supposed \"injuries\" that circulate the internet in the form of horror stories can be explained psychologically by the phenomenon of mass psychogenic events, instigated by fear + the nocebo effect.\n\n\\-The MMR does not cause any adverse neurological events or damage in the brains of laboratory animals, even at doses higher than used in humans.\n\n\\-The cumulative effect of the entire vaccination schedule (72 doses in children by the age of 18 today, in 2020) has been completely and thoroughly investigated for safety, and no issues have been found.\n\n\\-Vaccines have rigorous long-term safety studies for all potential of carcinogenicity, fertility, and long-term health adverse effects, and no issues have been found.\n\n\\-Despite some ethical concerns raised, several vaccinated vs. unvaccinated studies have been conducted. It was found that vaccinated children have significantly lower rates of allergies, chronic health problems, and neurological issues.\n\n\\-Vaccines are thought to have a potential neuroprotective and anti-cancer effect, which is still being studied. It is suspected that vaccines may prevent infertility, dementia, and cancer, although further investigation is needed.\n\n\\-All clinical trials for vaccines use double-blinded trials with saline placebos, which is the gold standard in medical research.\n\n\\-The FDA has an independent taxpayer-funded committee to examine and analyze all raw data from vaccine clinical trials. Scientists and data analysts conducting this research have extensive background testing to ensure no conflicts of interest in any pharmaceutical company. This debunks the myth of \"conflict of interest\" regarding vaccine manufacturers funding their own safety studies for FDA/CDC approval.\n\n\\-There are comprehensive laws to prevent the myth of the “revolving door” phenomenon that anti-vaxers like to use as proof of government-pharmaceutical corruption. If a scientist/researcher who investigated vaccine safety has had any financial ties to a pharmaceutical company, they are disqualified from the vaccine approval committee. Similarly, once an individual has worked in the field of vaccine approval for the FDA/CDC, they are unable to accept positions as pharmaceutical-hired scientists. These laws prevent conflicts of interest between vaccine approval and pharmaceutical profit.\n\n\\-Studies of vaccinated vs unvaccinated infants have thoroughly refuted any claims linking vaccines to SIDS.\n\n\\-The USA has very high vaccination rates as well as one of the lowest rates of infant mortality in all developed nations.\n\n\\-France, which has a notoriously high rate of vaccine hesitancy, has higher rates of autism, SIDS, and chronic illnesses than other developed countries of similar socioeconomic structure.\n\n\\-Autism is “more prevalent” due to more advanced and specific diagnostic criteria. Once diagnostic criteria was established, people of older generations (age 50’s-80’s) were found to have nearly identical rates of autism to those of younger generations (age 40’s and under).\n\n**Source: CDC, WHO, and FDA.**\n\nIf an antivaxer ever tries to argue with you about the safety of vaccines, this comprehensive list of facts will immediately shut down all their false claims and misunderstanding. Don’t let false information spread! Share this to anyone who needs to hear it.\n\nTL;DR: FACTS to fight + win any antivax debate.",

Teams of US & foreign scientists vaccinated animals with the four most promising vaccines. At first, the experiment seemed successful as all the animals developed a robust antibody response to coronavirus. However, when the scientists exposed the vaccinated animals to the wild virus, the results were horrifying. Vaccinated animals [suffered hyper-immune responses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22536382) including inflammation throughout their bodies, especially in their lungs. Researchers had seen this same “enhanced immune response” during human testing of the [failed RSV vaccine tests](https://cvi.asm.org/content/23/3/189) in the 1960s. [Two children died](https://cvi.asm.org/content/23/3/189).\n\nIn this video footage, Offit, Hotez and even Anthony Fauci (in an unguarded moment), warn that any new coronavirus vaccine could trigger lethal immune reactions “vaccine enhancement” when vaccinated people come in contact with the wild virus. Instead of proceeding with caution, Fauci has made the reckless choice to [fast track](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200316005666/en/Moderna-Announces-Participant-Dosed-NIH-led-Phase-1) vaccines, partially [funded by Gates](https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/bill-gates-says-foundation-will-invest-billions-fight-stop-covid-19/MMAFTSVGKZHPTEGYKEQKMRWTWU/), without critical [animal studies](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/11/researchers-rush-to-start-moderna-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-without-usual-animal-testing/) before moving into human clinical trials that could provide early warning of runaway immune response.\n\nGates (in the video) is so worried about the danger of adverse events that he says vaccines shouldn’t be distributed until governments [agree to indemnity](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/04/09/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-microsoft-co-founder-bill-gates-on-past-pandemic-warnings.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.Mail&fbclid=IwAR0RG79OtbdXUpY_ylULT6sY_Xo5D-cBQ0awSo6vGS19VnLGqB9z)against lawsuits. On February 4, 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) [website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html), there were only [11 active CV cases](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) in the USA, yet the U.S. quietly pushed through [Federal regulations](https://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/legal/prepact/Pages/COVID19.aspx) giving coronavirus vaccine makers full immunity from liability.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"...\"",

Eight of those children received the MMR vaccine. He concluded the article saying they couldn't prove a connection between the MMR vaccine and the gastrointestinal issues because the evidence is inadequate. Nowhere in the article he said there was a link between autism and the vaccine, until Wakefield claimed that it did in a press conferences.\n\nHis article was published in *the Lancet*, a well-known medicinal journal, and he was known to be a prestigious and highly regarded doctor( he's the doctor who identify the cause of Crohn's disease), so when the public heard of the vaccine-autism link, the public ate it up, fear arose, and vaccination rates dropped.\n\nThe article and his claims are farfetch once you look at the detail. First, the size of his studies was too small, only 12 children, making any connection seem statistically significant. There was only a few variables were studies and according to him, those 12 children exhibited forms of autism (the symptoms were not akin to autism). Not only that, his study didn't have the Ethical Practice Committee approve the study, which is necessary to ensure that the research doesn't harm its participants.\n\nWhat's worse it that it was discovered after much denial that Wakefield was being funded $800,000 by a personal injury lawyer named Richard Barr, who needed evidence that autism was caused by vaccine for cases of parents of autistic children who were suing pharmaceutical companies for compensation. Five of the 12 children were even clients of Barr. Wakefield's collaborators didn't even know about the money and were furious enough to retract their names for the study. But Wakefield had another motive. He advocated that vaccines need to be safe and tells the public that the current MMR vaccine isn't safe. Prior to his study, he was applying for a vaccine patent, he wanted to make his own MMR vaccine and wanted to get rid of the completion.\n\nWakefield had his medical license evoked in 2005. This should have been the end of the myth, but sadly no. He moved to the USA and is still highly regarded by people. Now his MMR and autism phase is dying down, but his new topic takes the spotlight, mercury in vaccines.",

   "body": "Everyone knows that mercury is harmful of the body as it is classified as a neurotoxin. So the thought of thimerosal being injected into our children and our bodies is concerning, since it does contain some mercury.\n\nBut mercury has different forms. The one that is dangerous is methylmercury. In terms of chemistry, it is the combination of a mercury atom to one carbon atom. It is known to be very dangerous to all living beings. Out of all forms of mercury, methylmercury is absorbed the easily and can even cross the blood brain barrier. Since, there are tiny tiny doses of it in contaminated food, like fish, which is why pregnant women are told to avoid seafood.\n\nI wanted to clarify that methylmercury was never used in vaccines. While thimerosal does have mercury, it is not methylmercury. It is ethlymercury.\n\nEthlymercury has two carbon atoms, instead of one, which drastically changes its properties and abilities. Due to its size, it's hard for it to cross the blood brain barrier and it's quickly excreted.\n\nDespite this, in 2002, thimerosal was removed from nearly all vaccines due to, not under the prove that it is harmful, but the idea that is has the potential for harm from the general public. This might have been due because of an article called \"Autism: A Novel Form of Mercury Poisoning\" . It was published by a group of parents in the 2001 that linked autism to mercury poisoning and the thimerosal was to blame. This article was not reviewed by any medical or scientific professionals, but it stirred up the public enough for the preservative to be removed.",

But without those preservatives, vaccines will have a very short shelf life and then afterward inefficient.  Parents may question if that's enough reason to expose their children to poison. I wanted to reassure and inform that those ingredients are harmless, despite its name and known uses, because of its dosage.\n\nAnything in the world can act as a poison or be completely harmless depending on the dosage. So just because something sounds good or bad doesn't mean that any dosage of it remains so. For example, too much vitamin A can actually poison you and damage your liver.\n\nHere is a list of some ingredients in vaccines and their dosage, as well as some usages:\n\n* Aluminum hydroxide: Used as a adjuvant (helps with efficacy of vaccine) in the DTap (0.625 mg). Also used antacids and in infant formula (0.225 mg per liter).\n* Formaldehyde: Prevent growth of harmful bacteria in vaccine. All vaccine combined has 1.2 mg of it, while 1 kg of bananas has 16.3 mg.\n* Monosodium Glutamate: Help preserve vaccines and used as a flavor enhancer. Some flu vaccines contain 0.188 mg of MSG, while grape juice can contain 0.258 mg per 100 grams.\n* Sodium Chloride: Another name for salt and some vaccine have them to keep them in a state that will not badly affect the cells.\n* Sorbitol: Preservative, found naturally in fruits, and also used a sweetener in sugar-free products. MMR vaccine has 15 mg and 1 stick of sugar-free gum has 1.25 g.",

The local news just advertised 1 in 4 measles patients needs to be hospitalized... \n\nAccording to\n\nhttps://www.autism-watch.org/news/lancet.shtml\n\nIn 2004, ten of the study's authors issued a \"retraction\" which stated: \"We wish to make it clear that in this paper no causal link was established between MMR vaccine and autism as the data were insufficient.\"\n\nSo just how different is that from the studies conclusion? See for yourself - \n\n\"We did not prove an association between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and the syndrome described. Virological studies are underway that may help to resolve this issue.\n\nIf there is a causal link between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and this syndrome, a rising incidence might be anticipated after the introduction of this vaccine in the UK in 1988...\n\n\n....We have identified a chronic enterocolitis in children that may be related to neuropsychiatric dysfunction. In most cases, onset of symptoms was after measles, mumps, and rubella immunisation. Further investigations are needed to examine this syndrome and its possible relation to this vaccine.\"\n\nIsn't the 2004 \"retraction\" Saying the same thing as the study? Nothing was proved. \n\nThe study was published in 1998.. It was retracted a very long time later. Why did it take so long? \n\nSome of the claims of fraudulent activities aim at Dr. Wakefield's payment to be a witness or a supposed link to an application for a vaccine patent. \nHave you seen how much money Dr Offit and Plotkin make from all the vaccines. They have the patent on the R in MMR yet they are often called as witness against Dr Wakefield or give expert witness for a news report. \nThese two are part of the vaccine club, they are luteal millionaires as a result of vaccines and if Dr Wakefield's credibility is questioned over a 55 thousand pound payment and possible vaccine patent how much more should these other two be muted.",

   "body": "The 1 in 1000 fatality rate from measles is a known calculation error by the CDC. \n\nIt's actually closer to 1 in 10,000 or 0.01% of cases. \n\nTo put it in perspective, 1 in 10,000 is the same probability of getting struck by lightning in your lifetime. (Howstuffworks.com) \n\nProof: https://physiciansforinformedconsent.org/critical-calculation-error-in-background-information-for-hearing-on-vaccines-save-lives-what-is-driving-preventable-disease-outbreaks-on-march-5-2019/\n\nPrior to the introduction of the measles vaccine in 1963, “there were an estimated 3 to 4 million people infected with measles in the United States, and as many as 500 related deaths each year,” which is correct. However, this computes to a number of deaths which, at most, is one in 6,000 (3,000,000 divided by 500). More precisely, between 1959 and 1962, about 400 measles deaths occurred among about 4,000,000 measles cases, which results in a one in 10,000 (0.01%) chance of a child dying from measles, not one in 500 or one in 1,000. By comparison, over 23,000 infant deaths occur every year in the U.S. and thus the chance of a child dying in his or her first year of life is currently one in 170 (0.6%)—this is 60 times the risk of a child dying from measles in 1962, a time period when almost every child had measles by age 15.\n\nThe reason this calculation error unfortunately commonly occurs is because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes case-fatality rates based on the number of reported cases only. And, since it is estimated that nearly 90% of measles cases are benign and therefore not reported to the CDC, the widely publicized measles case-fatality rate is a 10-fold miscalculation. Such an error has grave public health consequences. \n\n1 in 10,000 lightning strike odds:\nhttps://health.howstuffworks.com/diseases-conditions/death-dying/odds-of-death.htm\n\n",

Hedrich, a health officer in Chicago, IL observed that during 1900-1930, outbreaks of measles in Boston, MA appeared to be suppressed when 68% of the children contracted the virus.3 Subsequently in the 1930s, Dr. Hedrich observed that after 55% of the child population of Baltimore, MD acquired measles, the rest of the population appeared to be protected. It was that observation that formed the basis for mass vaccination campaigns.4\n\nWhen the mass vaccination campaign for measles in the U.S. began in earnest in the mid-1960s, the U.S. Public Health Service planned to vaccinate over 55% (based on the Baltimore observation) of the U.S. population, and it announced that it fully expected to eradicate measles by 1967. When that didn’t happen, the Public Health Service came up with vaccination rate figures of 70-75% as the way to ensure herd immunity. When eradication was still not achieved at those rates, public health officials jacked up the rates to 80%, 83%, 85%, and ultimately to 90%.\n\nThe process by which the decisions to raise the rates is unclear. Was it based on some scientific methodology or assumptions? Or were the decisions simply made because officials felt pressure to fulfill their promises to fully eradicate measles? Did they ever consider pausing and re-evaluating the original premise behind the theory of herd immunity? Or did they trudge on, arbitrarily raising the bar?\n\nNow the rate is up to 95% to achieve herd immunity. But as we see with the continual outbreaks, even at 95% we still do not have full immunity. In China, the vaccination rates are even higher—99%. But there are also still measles outbreaks there.  So is the answer 100%? And what if at 100% you still get outbreaks? We’ve gone from herd immunity supposedly achieved at 55% to herd immunity that is clearly not achieved even at 95%. At what point will public health officials have to confront the possibility that herd immunity may not be the best theory on which to base vaccination policy?\n\n3 - Hedrich AW.

I've learned not to challenge her on it because it's gotten me nowhere but she views my beliefs as a personal attack on her directly. She runs a supplements company and has traveled the world teaching about the dangers of vaccines and how it caused my youngest brother to get autism. It's actually the entire basis of why she's a Trump supporter because of his stance on the issue, but that's another issue entirely.\n\n I know the basis of the argument for vaccines (herd-immunity, diseases are worse etc) but our discussions always boil down to sources and generally what or who to believe. She has the assumption that all CDC sympathetic media or articles are in the pockets of big pharma so they can make all their profits through vaccines. I anticipate this being the crux of the argument following this movie. I don't believe I will break through to her but I do hope to get a better understanding of the issue before I go into 2 hours of full propaganda, then to be bombarded with questions. \n\nHere's a link of a bunch of articles she views as \"proof\" of what she believes:\n\nhttp://vaccinepapers.org/\n\n I've gone through most of it and don't really know what to make of them. There's a lot of prefacing for the studies that are mentioned but like I said, I'm no expert. What do some of you make of these links and/or what valuable information can you give me before going to see \"VAXXED\"?\n\nEdit: So I went to see the movie and most of it isn't about what you think. Rather it's about the CDC coverup of the study that showed correlation between autism and the MMR. It's actually really compelling on that front and I urge those of you to go and watch it for yourselves and then come back to discuss what you saw. Don't just take my word for it.",

If everything she claims in this post is true, then vaccines are the devil. I know that's not the case, but I'm not knowledgeable enough to refute most of her points, so I was wondering if any of you were.\n\nHere's the post:\n\n\"Contrary to the view that non-vaccinators are uneducated fools duped by conspiracy theories, most have taken the time to study the scientific data that show most vaccinations not to be worth the risk. Even the Supreme Court has deemed vaccination to be \"unavoidably unsafe\".\nAre you aware that, by law, the CDC sponsors a vaccine injury database called VAERS -- the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. According to VAERS data, over the past 10 years alone, 26,793 people have been hospitalized with vaccine injuries and 2,081 have died. Did you know that 162 young people, mostly healthy teenage girls, have now died after receiving the HPV vaccine?\nDid you know that, in exchange for granting legal immunity to vaccine manufacturers, the US government sponsors a vaccine court that awards compensation to families with vaccine-injured children? This court has paid out billions of dollars to families, including for children whose autism was deemed to have been caused by vaccination. Did you know that a 2005 FDA report on the Tripedia DTP vaccine listed many neurological problems as potential side effects, including autism?\nDid you know that one of the key studies that supposedly exonerated vaccines from causing autism was authored by Poul Thorsen, now a fugitive wanted for money laundering and fraud? And that, in contrast to what is constantly repeated in the media, there are dozens of studies implicating vaccines as playing a role in causing autism, as well as many other neurological and chronic diseases, including Type 1 diabetes (also on the rise in children)? Did you know that a 2011 study in Germany that compared vaccinated versus unvaccinated populations found unvaccinated children to be far more healthy, with much lower rates of asthma, allergies, ear infections, epilepsy, gluten sensitivities, GERD, anxiety and depression, autism, and dyslexia?\nDid you know that a growing number of physicians and immunologists are admitting that vaccination may not be worth the risk? They point out that, in an effort to avoid the childhood diseases (which only 60 years ago were considered beneficial because they triggered true immunity and spurts in child development), we may be causing an increase in chronic disease and a form of disease immunity that is not as strong and longlasting? Did you know that recent outbreaks of childhood diseases among vaccinated children is not due to their \"contamination\" by unvaccinated children or due to loss of so-called \"herd immunity\", but rather, is usually occurring in completely vaccinated populations because their artificial immunity is waning?\nPlease understand. Parents who wish to forego vaccination for their children are not asking that others follow their lead. They simply want to be permitted to follow their beliefs and not be forced to administer these drugs to their children. Indeed, many of these families already have a vaccine-injured child. Each year, the extremely powerful vaccine industry sponsors media campaigns (like the one we are currently experiencing) whose ultimately goal is to force everyone to become their customers. As a society, we must preserve our human right not to be forceably injected and medicated against our will.\"",

People have been working on AIDS for decades but retroviruses are particularly difficult to vaccinate against. We could create an effective flu vaccine if we were sure which of the many variants would appear in a given year.  At the moment current covid vaccines have moderate to great effectiveness against current strains but it is possible vaccines may need to be tweaked a bit if more resistant variants emerge.  The mRNA technology fortunately allows more rapid development and modification of vaccines.",

Keep in mind as well that none of the vaccines are 100% effective.

As you may know, vaccination is essential because it helps provide immunity before an individual is exposed to certain life-threatening diseases such as chickenpox or measles. There is a possibility that your child might get measles for an example, but very unlikely. According to the Mayo Clinic, more than 93% of people who get the first dose of MMR develop immunity to measles. After the second dose, about 97% of people are protected. The 2020 Recommended immunizations for children from birth through 6-years old from CDC are linked [here](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/downloads/parent-ver-sch-0-6yrs.pdf). According to the CDC, “everyone six months and older should get the influenza (flu) vaccine every season. \n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nI am not a medical doctor.

I dont care if I die I dont really fear death. I can see why people will hate this. *sigh* you cant even voice your own opinion anymore but hopefully you guys see my point. Someday a major disease could mutate to get past our vaccines that take years to build and wed have to keep making our vaccines stronger. Ive realized that its all about survival... Viruses and germs dont want to harm us but they naturally do... they naturally are a disease, they just use our body as a host, and you see how we slaughter cows to eat, (No im no vegan either, I love meat) thats how we survive, I know viruses are singlw celled and are not a complex lifeform im just showing you my opinion and I dont really care if anyone asked its reddit I just wanna hesr other peoples opinions too amd for people to get to know why some people dont use vaccines. peace guys",

Either way, will discuss it again.\n\n\nYou missed this paragraph I guess, that the data is not showing a clear causation. \n\n> \"A second issue is that clearly not enough time has elapsed since the switch to aP to draw definitive conclusions about the resumption of cycles of B. pertussis incidence. While the data appear most consistent with asymptomatic transmission from aP vaccinated individuals, it may be many years before enough time has elapsed to be able to rule out this hypothesis.\"\n\n\nAlso other disclaimers:\n\n>Our model does not explicitly account for evolution of the B. pertussis bacterium [7, 56] — a factor which may play a large role in the epidemiological dynamics of B. pertussis. For example, it has been posited that B. pertussis has adapted to vaccination in several European countries. Mooi et al. (2001) identified genetic changes between pre- and post-vaccination strains of B. pertussis [8]. Despite this evidence, including evolution would merely increase the number of individuals susceptible to both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection and would yield exactly the opposite pattern of population genomic variation than seen empirically.\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________\nThe aP vaccine (acellular pertussis) is reliable for kids especially, somewhat similar to the rotaviral vaccine and maybe the meningococcal one too, because it offers immunity for a few  critical years, when kids are small and vulnerable. Unlike the whole cell pertussis vaccine, which gives a longer and sturdier immunity.\n\nNobody expects these vaccines to be efficient and create immunity per life. The same with tetanus and diphtheria. You have to get boosters to be actually protected for longer periods of time! Otherwise your antibody count will become super low and you become susceptible to the infection AND maybe becoming a carrier. Sure, not the case of tetanus, but the case of diphtheria. pertussis...\n\nWhy? Because with the aP vaccine, immunity is not stimulated enough, as there are less antigens in it to \"irritate\" the immune system and create enough antibodies. Hence you basically become unimmunized. Just like unvaccinated persons. \n\n\n\nThis was observed in a trial for animals too. And by this, we get back to your previous ideas that unvaccinated kids are not that much of a danger. They are though, because they become even a bigger reservoir of infection.\n\n>>\"However, Merkel notes that there was a “startling” difference in acellular-vaccinated animals: “After they were infected, they became colonised and remained colonised longer than unvaccinated animals. Although they weren’t sick, they were carrying the bacterium in their airways.” When these animals were co-housed, they were able to infect other, unvaccinated, animals.\n\n>>A similar pattern was seen with whole-cell vaccinated animals, but they were able to clear the infection within two weeks — much quicker than the acellular-vaccinated animals. “To a large extent, this can explain the increase we are seeing in cases of pertussis,” says Merkel.\"\n\nhttps://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/news-and-analysis/features/stopping-whooping-cough-in-its-tracks/20206396.article?firstPass=false\n\nEither way, the conclusion was ok and mentioned that the more there are vaccinated, just like with polio, the less risk of contracting a disease if you have a large percentage of the population vaccinated. It's called herd immunity! And possible eradication. Look at polio, it still can be transmitted through feces, for a while after getting the vaccine. Yet in so many countries it's been eradicated.\n\nAlso, the problem is here that both the study you linked and the one I linked, failed to mention the antibody count. They're just mentioning waning immunity, which is not enough for a conclusion. \n\nThis remains my point of argument, to what you said: you're not immunised,  or properly immunised anymore if you manage to colonise a bacteria you're vaccinated against. Aka: you need the booster.",

The potential for this type of vaccine failure has been observed in humans where reanalyses of aP vaccine studies revealed that individuals vaccinated with components of the aP vaccine were protected against disease, but not bacterial colonization** \\[[10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4482312/#CR10), [11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4482312/#CR11)\\]. This is in addition to the extant, but limited, evidence for natural asymptomatic infection \\[[12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4482312/#CR12)–[14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4482312/#CR14)\\].  \n>  \n>Warfel et al. point out that asymptomatic infection in aP vaccinated individuals, and subsequent transmission, may partially account for the increase in observed *B. pertussis* incidence. However, from a public health perspective, the presence of vaccine-induced or naturally infected asymptomatic individuals who transmit disease could have consequences beyond facilitating an increase in incidence. In response to Warfel et al., Domenech de Cellès et al. (2014) \\[[15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4482312/#CR15)\\] argue that a reduction in incidence among unvaccinated individuals in a population with high aP coverage shows that aP must reduce *B. pertussis* transmission to some extent. It may be that aP vaccinated infected people are less efficient at transmitting *B. pertussis* compared with unvaccinated infected people, though it is not clear to what extent \\[[16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4482312/#CR16)\\].  \n>  \n>Here, we examine incidence and genetic data to provide empirical support for asymptomatic transmission and then construct mathematical models of *B. pertussis* transmission to explore the public health consequences of asymptomatic transmission. Our results suggest that: 1) there is strong empirical support for asymptomatic transmission from both the epidemiological and genomic data; 2) the presence of asymptomatic transmitters will bias estimates of vaccine efficacy derived from observations of stochastic fadeouts across cities; and 3) asymptomatic transmission provides the most parsimonious explanation for many of the observed patterns associated with current *B. pertussis* dynamics in the US and UK (that is, the resurgence of cases, the changes in age-specific attack rates, the observed level of bacterial genetic variation, and the failure of ring-vaccinating, or “cocooning”, unvaccinated infants).\n\nThere is a Huuuge difference between being an antivaxer (who is biased against vaccines and not following science) and being willing to acknowledge that science shows not every vaccine is able to reliably prevent transmission",

   "body": "1.) The movie they cited as their source, “Vaxxed”, was written by Andrew Wakefield. He is a former UK doctor who was hired by a group of parents to find a link between vaccines and autism. He published a study finding the link in the highly respected medical journal the “Lancet”. It was later found that he falsified the results of his study, and also performed very unethical and invasive tests on children with autism to “prove” his findings (think unnecessary spinal taps and other painful procedures). His was the first, and I believe only, article to be retracted in the Lancet in all its years of publication. Wakefield was stripped of his medical license and ability to continue practicing medicine in the UK. No doctors, in any country, have ever completed a study that replicated his results. An important factor of scientific studies is they need to be repeatable. If nobody else is getting the same results, his study is suspect regardless of the ethics of it (but that’s a huge deal anyways) I would be HIGHLY skeptical of anything that has his name on it.\n\n2.) The movie Vaxxed is only showing one “side” of the story, if you can call it that. It’s meant to scare people and to convince them that vaccines are bad. It isn’t a sound source because it’s heavily biased and does not present all the information, only the information that supports their narrative.\n\n3.) Vaccine injuries are a real thing. However, they are also incredibly rare. I am not a doctor, or medical professional in any capacity, so I don’t have hard science for you. But look at the number of people who have been fully vaccinated and compare that to the number of people who have vaccine caused injuries. My entire life, 99% of the people I know are fully vaccinated, and not a single one of them had any impairment attributed to vaccines. I’d do some research into the actual chances of vaccine injury. But I’m almost positive that the chances of a vaccine injury are significantly smaller than the chances of injury from other routine or necessary/life saving procedures that we don’t bat an eye at (think surgeries and the like)\n\n4.) The hole in the logic of anti-Vaxxers that I’ve never heard them answer is this: if you break an arm, where are you going to go? Answer: the doctor’s. They wouldn’t think twice about it. I know anti-vaxxers who have rushed their children to the doctor for a high fever. However, they also claim big pharma is a conspiracy and trying to hurt you. If the vaccines aren’t safe, how can anything the doctor says/does be trusted? Either they are in on the conspiracy or they are dumb enough to be taken in by it, and either way how can you trust them? Also, the FDA approves the vaccines, and they also approve the other meds you might take/a doctor might prescribe you. How can you trust ANY of that if the vaccines are a huge conspiracy? You’re better off staying away entirely if that’s the case.\n\n5.) The ingredients in vaccines sound scary, sure. I wouldn’t trust myself to mix a vaccine safely. However, I am not a doctor. I didn’t spend years studying medicine, and then following strict procedures and countless peer-reviewed and tested studies to have the know-how to make vaccines. Just like I wouldn’t trust myself to wire a house, because I have no experience, but I would trust an electrician. Or how I would trust a cardiologist to perform open heart surgery on me but I wouldn’t trust my husband because he isn’t a medical professional.\n\n6.) On their whole “ingestion vs injection” thing; broccoli is totally safe to ingest. We recommend people ingestion broccoli as it’s very good for you. We do not recommend people injecting broccoli into their bloodstream. Again, I’m not a doctor, but injecting broccoli into your body will kill you. Should we get rid of broccoli?\n\n7.) Vaccines seem unnecessary, but it’s because they work. Vaccines stop the spread of dangerous and even deadly diseases. When enough people vaccinate, it protects the vulnerable populations (elderly, very young, immunocompromised, and those who for one reason or another cannot receive vaccines). The disease cannot spread, causing it to effectively die out, or at least prevents it from becoming a pandemic. This whole Coronavirus thing is actually a good illustration of how bad a pandemic can be and how beneficial these vaccines are. Smallpox, measles, heck even the flu, all used to tear through communities and kill/injure a lot of people. Modern medicine helps, but the vaccines keep it from spreading like wildfire in the first place. When was the last measles epidemic? Or the last smallpox outbreak? We vaccinate for those, and while a case of measles or two might pop up every now and then, we aren’t shutting down cities because of an outbreak.\n\nI hope this helps! Sorry for the novel, this is everything I’ve been wanting to say to my anti-Vaxxer friends and haven’t really been able to, so typing this up was kind of cathartic.",

I don't think this is an entirely conclusive study\n\n**STUDY #3:** This is comparing different countries, which is just asking for confounding variables, I'm not even sure I want to bother reading through a study that I can tell from the abstract is so inconclusive.\n\nAlso, the only author is  journalist who runs an antivax group\n\n**STUDY #4** is a case report of an unusual event and is inconclusive because such case reports can't determine if the deaths were a coincidence or not\n\n**STUDY #5** Is of an unsafe vaccine that was withdrawn from the market over safety concerns and has now been replaced with a different version [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/rota.html#vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/rota.html#vaccines)\n\n**STUDY #6** Is just a temporal correlation, one of the weakest forms of evidence, and c an be used to draw all kind of ridiculous conclusions, examples here:[https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations)\n\nThis study also uses number of pediatricians in a state as the measure of access to care, which is ridiculous, as finance, transportation, population, geography, ect also affect access to care\n\nAlso, the author is an economist, not a doctor\n\n**STUDY #7** Just says a whistleblower said vaccines cause autism, a lot more info is needed to know what is going on here\n\n**STUDY #8** is interesting but jumps to conclusions, as the info provided is insufficient to establish causation, it may be that an overactive immune system causes both the autoantibodies and the abnormal immune response to measles vaccine, rather than that the vaccines causes the autoantibodies.

   "body": "**TL:DR It takes time to read multiple studies, but I read though most of the first one and it looks pretty good, it suggests that around 1 in 168 kids have a side effect leading to an ER visit or hospitalization caused by the first dose of MMR and chickenpox vaccines, although most were just ER visits without hospitalization**\n\n**I will look into the rest of them in coming days (or hours), but looking through all 39(!) will take some time**\n\nAnalysis of the first study (sorry it's so long, science is just complicated sometimes): The authors appear to be from legitimate institutions, and the methods of the study look legit, they found that among kids who go to the ER within 28 days after the 12 month vaccines in Ontario, more of them went to the ER between 4-12 days after vaccination than when to the ER on days 20-28, and this was statistically significant, using a legitimate definition of statistically significant (95% CI, and p-value <0.0001)\n\nThis suggests that that vaccines are causing kids to go to the ER between 4 and 12 days after vaccination, which is consistant with the expected timeframe for reactions to live vaccines such as the MMR and chickenpox vaccine, both of which are given at 12 months\n\nThe most obvious form of bias would be to compare time periods of different lengths, but they are comparing a 9 day period to a 9 day period, so no issue there\n\nAnother potential issue with a study like this study is that the rate of ER visits on days 20-28 is assumed to be non-vaccine related, and used as a control, so any vaccine related ER visits in this period would not only be missed but would contribute to a lower estimate of the number of day 4-12 ER visits that are attributable to vaccines, this bias would actually make the study underestimate the dangers of vaccines, but I don't know that it was a major issue based on the graphs provided\n\nThe fact that they vaccine related ER visits had almost the exact same severity score as the none vaccine related ones might suggest that the \"vaccine related\" ER visits and non vaccine related ones, are for the exact same conditions, meaning that none of them are actually vaccine related (or that they all are, but this wouldn't explain the ER visits right before vaccination). However, there was no increase in facial injuries in the period of increased ER visits after vaccination, suggesting that the increase was actually do to different conditions, ie, they were actually vaccine related. Vaccine related and non-vaccine related ER visits could be the same average severity if this is a threshold at which parents take kids to the ER, and both vaccine related and non vaccine related ER visits are rarely more serious than this threshold\n\nThe increase in ER visits after 18 month vaccinations (which include a second dose of MMR and chickenpox) was little to none, which is consistant with the fact that once you have had the 1 dose of a live virus vaccine you are usually vaccinated against side effects of subsequent doses, and this suggests that the increase in ER visits after the 12 months vaccines is either due to the live vaccines (MMR and/or chickenpox), or one of the non live vaccines that is given at 12 months but not at 18 months, although the timing 4-12 days after vaccination is more consistant with a live vaccine",

   "body": "> Their immune system is burdened as well as purged of natural disease detourants.\n\nI don't think there is any evidence for this, and I struggle to imagine any biologically plausible mechanism that would cause this. \n\nVaccines are not especially burdensom to the immune system. On the contrary we encounter a dozen novel antigens per day, and at any given point our immune systems are in the process of combating 1000+ different insults (though the vast majority are mostly harmless like pet dander or pollen). \n\nMoreover, today's vaccination schedule is far less insulting than the one our parents went through. Today's children get more overall needle sticks, but smaller doses each time, and there are fewer novel antigens in said vaccines. In the 1960-70s they had no good way to determine which antigens to target to provoke an immune response, so they basically used brute force. Some vaccines had hundreds even thousands of antigens like the old Pertussis vaccine. Probably only a handful were relevant, but they couldn't isolate them, so they just gave you the whole load. Today we're much better at isolating the relevant ones. \n\nI saw a paper about this a few years back, IIRC a child born in the 2010s will be exposed to about 150 novel antigens through the CDC recommended vaccination schedule, a kid born in the 1980s probably got 3000, and in larger doses (but fewer shots). We probably get 20,000+ per year naturally anyway. As such, the insult from vaccinations is not that unusual, and in fact, far less significant than actually getting the flu or measles. I don't think there is any evidence that vaccination makes people \"softer\".\n\nWhile hygiene theory suggest growing up in a sterile environment is a bad thing, there is no evidence that surviving horrible illnesses somehow makes you stronger. In fact, I'd wager the opposite. A serous measles infection for example, can royally screw with your immune system for years. \n\nAs to your question, I can't imagine how getting routine flu and TDAP shots would make you more susceptible to something like SARS or nCov. \n\nI'd guess modern epidemics are the result of habitat destruction via industrial agriculture, and  reckless slaughter practices, and increased human mobility. The 2014 West Ebola outbreak was not unusual in any biological way, the only thing that changed was that modern Africa is surprisingly well connected with significant flow of goods and people, whereas 1970s Africa was isolated and most Ebola outbreaks were easily contained.",

Zika was identified in the 1950s and is very similar to its flavivirus cousins (less dangerous than most). Avian flu (H5N1) is literally just one of many flu strains.\n\nThe first coronaviruses were identified in the 1960s, and are one of several that cause the common cold. You've almost certainly had a few coronavirus infections over the course of your life. SARS, MERS-CoV and the new nCov-2019 are unusually dangerous examples, but there is no evidence whatsoever that they were engineered.\n\nI don't see how vaccines could have anything to do with these recent spillovers either.

Obviously insurance system will affect antenatal care and screenings, which affect the risk/benefit analysis for something like the Hep B vaccine (which, again, is not the same as the vaccine you're mentioning in the UK). It's just a different healthcare system. That there are different immunization schedules isn't particularly surprising or even necessarily meaningful.\n\n>Aren't babies particularly sensitive when they are first borne?\n\nThe vaccine is tolerated fine, so I dunno what else this would imply that's worth addressing.\n\n>I was thinking that it makes more sense not to give unneeded vaccines or medications on the first day of life just to improve compliance\n\nIt's not \"unneeded\" on day 1 any more than day 60 or day 600. You derive more benefit from earlier vaccination by definition. It also improves compliance because you already have started the schedule, informed the parents, and can test the mother. \n\n>although if there are testing errors I can understand this\n\nThat and screening insufficiencies, etc. \n\n>Why are you always so hostile?\n\nWhy are you always quick to make sweeping and uninformed judgments? I've just got no patience for such nonsense, and if you have any intellectual honesty then you'll grit your teeth, take the lumps where you've earned them, and be better for it.\n\nYou might benefit from reading about this:\n\nhttps://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p2130.pdf",

In one study of a large health system in northern California, 93% of HBsAg-positive pregnant women were tested for HBV DNA (28). Most (94.9%) infants born to infected women receive recommended prophylaxis within 12 hours of birth (29). \n\n>>Universal HepB vaccine birth dose coverage, defined as 1 dose of vaccine administered by 3 days of life, is 71.1% (30), an increase from 50.1% during 2003–2005 prior to revised ACIP recommendations for the birth dose before hospital discharge (31), but below the Healthy People 2020 target of 85% (32).\n\nSo we have [three good reasons](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/rr/rr6701a1.htm). First, through failure to identify Hep B positive mothers through two different mechanisms, and for compliance reasons (the baby *is* right there, after all).\n\nNow the UK does it differently. They have both a different healthcare/insurance system, and they also use a hexavalent vaccine rather than monovalent Hep B vaccines. That's two levels of incongruent comparisons, and no particular substantive reason to delay other than if you support lower compliance rates and increased testing failure risks.\n\nBut, hey, glad you see no issue with it.",

When citing studies, make sure they don't have major conflicts of interest ***IMPORTANT*** This is NOT the most up to date evidence of the flu vaccine's effectiveness, I only cited this as a source for the fact that industry-funded studies are biased. Here are more up to date reviews:\n\nThis isn't remotely in line with FDA approval standards. I also don't see how the Cochrane review in any way justifies your opinion here unless you misunderstand what 'bias' is meant in these reviews.\n\nEdit: So I missed what you're likely referring to with this link, the warning at the bottom of this (and only this) Cochrane review. This review itself has no particular issue with or statement against industry funded studies and, of course, included many. The actual study you're trying to refer to is [this one](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.b354) by another study author on these Cochrane reviews you've cited. Notably these reviews are in line with reported influenza vaccine efficacy which is common, that being ~45%. \n\nI've taken one example from the 2009 review you have meant to cite as an example (see Wongsurakiat 2004 in Table 2): \n\n>>Study was conducted over one year. Conclusions support recommendation of annual vaccination (one dose is sufficient in adults, as strong response has been observed). Authors note that vaccine effectiveness has been shown, even if it was possibly administered too late (in region where study was carried out peak incidence of influenza occurs usually in May).\n\nAll totally in line with their results. They have strong evidence of an effect even with a later administration. Seasonal homogeneity isn't uncommon, so this is a bizarre complaint against strong statistical results and completely 'concordant' summary in the conclusion. In fact, the delayed administration of the first dose still being effective is totally in line with rapid waning of influenza vaccine efficacy. Plus the patients had a second booster dose which is not normally recommended for adults, further maintaining higher titer levels into the next season. On a cynical reading, one might think that patients sick in May were included even though vaccination began in June. In reality, given the study was conducted for a full calendar year which simply rolled over a month after 'normal peak' season, this means that vaccination began in June of 1997, included May 1998 (peak season) and went through October 1998. \n\n>>Comment: though authors state that effectiveness is shown for influenza related ARI only, and not influenza, they recommend vaccination for patients with COPD. \n\nBecause it demonstrated statistically significant reduction for influenza related ARI or, as referred to in the study, ILI. \n\n>>This means recommending vaccine though it is not effective against influenza and acute exacerbations. \n\nMisleading or incorrect wording. The Cochrane authors are distinguishing ILI and laboratory confirmed influenza virus infection (causing the pathology 'influenza'). As the original authors state, viral propagation from infection was only possible in 10% of those patients with ILI presentation. The paper does *not* demonstrate a *lack* of efficacy, but only *fails* to demonstrate *presence* of efficacy for lab confirmed influenza. Yet considering the serology confirmed increase in antibody titer, strong reduction in ILI, and lack of effect against non-influenza ARI, this is a terrible mischaracterization of the study and its conclusions. Usually there is no ability to distinguish between flu-ARI and non-flu-ARI. However in this case other viral agents were confirmed, giving much higher confidence in proper ILI designation. \n\n>>In addition, lack of comment on community viral circulation and vaccine content and matching make verification of effectiveness against ARI impossible.\n\nI have no idea what the Cochrane authors are saying here. Wongsurakiat et al *do* comment on circulating virus among the community, *do* comment on vaccine content, and *do* make a matching verification. The predominantly circulating type A flu was H3N2 at the time, of which the vaccine component was stated to be on target, and of which the majority of confirmed flu in the study was confirmed to be type A. moreover, they confirm specific titer increases for the study subjects in line with well-known protective level thresholds. And, finally, the authors *don't* suggest the vaccine has effect against ARI--that is to say all acute respiratory infections--and instead say it is true for *only* influenza-ARI. \n\nThis being a prime example in their table of discordance...I'm extremely disappointed. The Cochrane authors seem to dispute the sensitive nature of COPD patients to airway exacerbations and wholly ignore this supreme risk factor which any responsible clinician must weigh (risk) against perceived benefit of the vaccine (reward). See this excerpt:\n\n>>All the unvaccinated patients with moderate-to-severe\nCOPD who were hospitalized because of influenzarelated ARI required mechanical ventilation. One of\nthese patients with severe COPD died because of\nventilator-associated pneumonia. In contrast, none\nof the vaccinated patients required mechanical ventilatory support because of ARI related to influenza\nvirus infection.\n\nNow, these results might not be statistically significant, but they aren't evidence of it being \"not effective against influenza and acute exacerbations\" like the Cochrane authors state. Are the Cochrane authors *really* disputing the idea that influenza vaccination proved effective against ILI? Or are they just harping on the lack of distinction between ILI and lab-confirmed influenza? Because one of those questions has an obvious and practical answer for clinicians, and the other is an academic or philosophical exercise. I'm either missing something big, or this is a huge oversight on the part of the Cochrane authors. Cochrane authors are humans the same as all the other study authors. To conclude that industry funded studies are completely unreliable is not 'concordant' with the Cochrane authors themselves.",

It is usually the ones that call for more vaccination that have the hubris to believe the science is settled and we know everything there is to know about the human body and the immune system.  \n\nIt is the ones against vaccine choice that have the arrogance to demand everyone follow what they believe regardless of the individuals hurt along the way. The belief that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few and that the nation state should be allowed to tell an individual what to inject into their body are fascist ideals.\n\nFascism - anti-intellectual, anti-democratic, individual interests are subordinated to the good of the nation, forcibly suppresses opposition and criticism, regiments industry, commerce, etc., emphasizes an aggressive nationalism and often racism. \n\nAKA taking away an individual’s right to choose what is injected into their body despite numerous side effects and subjecting them to mass experimentation for “the good of the nation” while really just backing the ever growing pharmaceutical industry and suppressing any information that contradicts their interests. \n\nSo even if you don’t agree don’t force your ideals on others. \n\nThe nazis experimented on people. This led to the Nuremberg Trials and Code, detailing the human right for Informed Consent.\nhttps://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199711133372006\nVaccine mandates violate an individual’s rights for informed consent.\n\nThey are experimenting on people with vaccines (ex: from vaccine insert: “vaccines have not been tested for mutagenic or carcinogenic effects on pregnant women” yet we give vaccines to pregnant women anyway. Also, activating maternal immune system has risks to fetus. Yet they persist in their unjustified claims that it provides some benefit.",

According to the CDC a person with chickenpox is no longer contagious 24 hours after that last new spot appears, which shouldn't be more than a week or so after the start of symptoms\n\n>Arent your risk of getting shingles greatly increased if you have had the chicken pox?\n\nYes, it is pretty much impossible to get shingles if you haven't had chickenpox or a chickenpox vaccine\n\n>I am pregnant but had them as a kid, am i protected?\n\nThis is probably a question for your doctor, but there is no guarantee, and live vaccines such as chickenpox aren't recommended for pregnant women, so avoid exposure to infected people especially while pregnant, as harm to the fetus is possible [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/varicella.html#complications](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/varicella.html#complications)\n\n>If anti vaxxers get excited that your body builds natural immunity after having the disease, isnt that what vaccines do for your body except your never \"sick\"?\n\nYes, (well you can still get a little sick) but antivaxers are concerned about combinations of viruses in one vaccine, multiple vaccines at the same them, and chemical additives (although most of the chemical additives of concern are only used for vaccines against things that you can't build up immunity to from catching them)",

   "body": "So I’ll answer this as best I can, I am neither a doctor or an anti-vaxxer so anyone feel free to correct me/add on if I’m wrong:\n\nThe mom is excited about her kids getting chicken pox because basically once you’ve had chicken pox you’re unlikely (or immune, not 100% sure which) to get it again. Before the chicken pox vaccine it was common to try to get your kids exposed to chicken pox young because I believe the older you are the worse it is. So basically she’s trying to prevent her kids from getting it worse by exposing them young. Which would make sense except we have a vaccine so they never have to get it at all.\n\nThe point of vaccines isn’t just to protect you. It protects immunocompromised people who will her can’t get the vaccine, or can but are otherwise at risk of getting sick anyways. Two of my siblings are on immunosuppressants for other conditions they have. Despite being fully vaccinated, they get sick super easy and when they get sick it’s way worse because their immune systems are shot. So, like I said before, before the vaccine it made sense to expose your kids young to head off a worse infection later. Now, however, there’s no need to encourage the spread of a disease that could be dangerous for certain people groups (immunocompromised, elderly, young children, pregnant women, etc.).\n\nThe whole “natural immunity” thing that anti-vaxxers like to tout is not really what they make it sound like. They like to say your body is naturally able to fight off infection/keep you from getting sick. Which is true, to an extent, but when your kid gets chicken pox they don’t have a “natural immunity” to chicken pox. They still got chicken pox. It’s not like your body miraculously protects you from ever getting sick.\n\nIf you are concerned about your own health, I’d talk to your doctor. Since you are pregnant you can get sick easier. My personal, NOT MEDICAL, recommendation would be to stay away from your friend/her kids/her husband/etc until the chicken pox completely clears their house. Again, ask your doctor what they recommend, but I think steering clear is the safest bet here since you DON’T want chicken pox and pregnancy at the same time. That sounds terrible! Also remember that just because someone is not showing symptoms does not mean they aren’t carrying the disease. I’m not 100% sure how chicken pox spreads, so again please please talk to your doctor, but if your friend isn’t sick she may still be able to spread the disease to you.\n\nAs far as shingles goes, I think maybe having chicken pox as a kid makes you more likely to get it but I don’t think you have to have had chicken pox to get it. Again, not 100% sure here so hopefully someone smarter is able to fill this in!\n\nHope this helps!",

Or giving up and calling for censorship? \n\nOf course low efficacy doesn’t make them more harmful. But it does change the risk benefit analysis. \n\nOf course not all ILI are flu. Only about 3% - 9% of suspected flu cases are actually flu. The flu vaccine is less effective because as you admit “strains cannot be matched every single year. Of course that a virus with increased mutagenic shifts will not be matched for the vaccine every year.” So all the ILI are used to promote flu vaccines but vaccines may reduce 10-30% of 3-9% of “flu” cases. And these number are before factoring in primary and secondary vaccine failure and declining efficacy through repeat vaccination... that’s a low benefit. \n\nPlus you are now exposed to the risks of vaccines. Autoimmune diseases, GBS, etc\n\n- Is shown that repeated use of Al adjuvants and OVA (chicken egg whites) cause chronic inflammation in the immune system / allergic reactions \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2590830/#!po=0.543478\n\n“Guillain-Barré syndromeremains the most frequent neurological condition reported after influenza vaccination to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) since its inception in 1990. ...

There being no studies on vaccine safety doesn’t make them any safer. But it does allow officials the ability to claim there is no proof vaccines are harmful... convenient. \n\nFrom vaccine insert: “vaccines have not been tested for mutagenic or carcinogenic effects on pregnant women” yet we give vaccines to pregnant women anyway. Also, activating maternal immune system has risks to fetus. Yet they persist in their unjustified claims that it provides some benefit.\n\nMaternal immune activation http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6301/772 & https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24011823/\nImmune activation and autism \nhttp://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6301/772\n\nThimerasol which is mainly mercury can cross the placenta\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/22717874/\n\nThere is a very limited pharmacokinetic data concerning ethylmercury.

It’s an interesting theory that could explain a lot of the anomalies observed. \nhttp://whale.to/vaccine/sf1.html\n\nUm, no.  What they said was there was a correlation found they just don’t know why the efficacy is lower after repeated vaccination and more study was needed. \n\nI have smart amazing unvaccinated children. Thank you for asking. \n\nVaccine side effects are not rare. They are suppressed. There is a difference. \n\nVaccines are labeled “unavoidably unsafe” by the US Supreme Court and were protected from judicial oversight through legal channels (National Child Vaccine Injury Act in 1986), this took away legal channels for discovery and safety review. This happened because so many people said vaccines were injuring their loved ones.\n\nThe population at large is told adverse reactions are rare and not to worry about them. So Drs and patients alike do not know the risks and do not see a connection between their health issues and the vaccines they’ve received. (The majority of vaccine recipients are too young to tell us if they are experiencing side effects). If no one is looking at or tracking the risks then how can you say they’ve got a safe track record. We are not healthier overall and without a definitive cause for the health concerns it is irresponsible to say definitively that vaccines are not the cause.\n\nVaccine adverse events 1) compensated in vaccine court: Guillain-Barré syndrome, transverse myelitis, encephalopathy, seizure disorder, death, brachial neuritis, acute disseminated encephalomylites, Chronic inflammatory demyelination, polyradiculoneuropathy (CIPD), premature ovarian failure, Bell’s palsy, juvenile diabetes, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, infantile spasms, anaphylaxis, ocular myasthenia gravis, hypoxic seizure.\n\n2) listed on vaccine inserts: Autoimmune diseases, allergies, asthma, eczema, tics, Tourette’s syndrome, ADD / ADHD, autism, speech delay, neurodevelopment disorder, SIDS, narcolepsy.\n\nWhen an automated reporting system analyzed data reported over a 3 yr period it found that adverse reactions could be 26:1,000 or approximately 1 in 38. \nhttps://healthit.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/docs/publication/r18hs017045-lazarus-final-report-2011.pdf\n\nhttp://healthimpactnews.com/2017/harvard-immunologist-to-legislators-unvaccinated-children-pose-zero-risk-to-anyone/ “A recent study done in Ontario, Canada, established that vaccination actually leads to an emergency room visit for 1 in 168 children following their 12-month vaccination appointment and for 1 in 730 children following their 18-month vaccination appointment (see appendix for a scientific study, Item #5).”\n\n1 in 640 have a seizure from mmr https://physiciansforinformedconsent.org/measles/vrs/\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vaccines/mmrv/mmrv-febrile-seizures.html\n“The rate of seizures in this timeframe was 85 per 1000 person-years in the MMRV vaccine group compared to 42 per 1000 in the MMR and varicella vaccine group. This risk was about 2 times higher in children who received the combination shot (MMRV) versus the single shots (MMR and varicella).”\n\n“Approximately 40 cases of death and permanent injury from the MMR vaccine are reported to VAERS annually” and only about 1-10% of adverse events are reported. So that could mean approximately 400-4000 deaths or permanent injuries from the mmr vaccine annually.\n\n“As of March 31, 2018, there have been more than 89,355 reports of measles vaccine reactions, hospitalizations, injuries and deaths following measles vaccinations made to the federal Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), including 445 related deaths, 6,196 hospitalizations, and 1,657 related disabilities. Over 60% of those adverse events occurred in children three years old and under.” https://physiciansforinformedconsent.org/measles/vrs/\n\nAfter automating adverse event reports at Harvard Pilgrim, the developers of this system asked the CDC to take the final step of linking VAERS with the Harvard Pilgrim system so that these reports could be automatically transmitted into VAERS. Instead, the CDC refused to cooperate. As the Harvard grant recipients explained: Unfortunately, there was never an opportunity to perform system performance assessments because the necessary CDC contacts were no longer available and the CDC consultants responsible for receiving data were no longer responsive to our multiple requests to proceed with testing and evaluation. After three years and spending $1 million of taxpayers’ money, the CDC refused to even communicate with the HHS’ Harvard Medical School grant recipients. While HHS generally strongly supports automating public health surveillance systems, when it comes to vaccine safety, the CDC has only supported projects that would limit VAERS to passive surveillance. Automation would improve safety and address many of the long-standing issues and limitations raised by CDC regarding VAERS.37 Capturing “fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events” thirty years after the passage of the 1986 Act is unacceptable – and potentially deadly. https://icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/whitepapers/VaccineSafety-Version-1.0-October-2-2017.pdf",

They also found that vaccine effectiveness was 27-41 percent higher for adults who were vaccinated for the first time in the past five years, compared to those who got the vaccine almost every year. She said reasons for the increase in effectiveness is not yet clear and more research is needed to understand how repeated flu vaccination affects the immune system.\"\n\nYou know what that means, mister scientific method? That means THAT NO CORRELATION WAS FOUND.\n\nSO WHERE'S YOUR FUCKING HARD PROOF, WHERE'S YOUR EVIDENCE? \n\n\nI really hope you don't reproduce and just so you know, logical fallacies don't confirm your bullshit.

The belief that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few and that the nation state should be allowed to tell an individual what to inject into their body are fascist ideals.\n\nFascism - anti-intellectual, anti-democratic, individual interests are subordinated to the good of the nation, forcibly suppresses opposition and criticism, regiments industry, commerce, etc., emphasizes an aggressive nationalism and often racism. \n\nAKA taking away an individual’s right to choose what is injected into their body despite numerous side effects and subjecting them to mass experimentation for “the good of the nation” while really just backing the ever growing pharmaceutical industry and suppressing any information that contradicts their interests. \n\nSo even if you don’t agree don’t force your ideals on others.",

   "body": "Lol. These are quotes from the studies. And the studies are trying to figure out why the flu vaccine causes this decrease in efficacy. Feel free to read them and let me know your interpretation. \n\nAs far as group immunity...\nNote the “no decline in transmission” below \n\nAccording to a Cochrane review the flu vaccine IF it has the correct strains circulating reduces the likelihood of catching the flu from 4% if unvaccinated to 1% if vaccinated. A 3% risk difference. So not much of a benefit there. Also the study concluded that there is no evidence that the flu vaccine affect complications, such as pneumonia, or transmission. The CDC combines pneumonia rates with flu rates to estimate the number of deaths from the flu, creating extremely exaggerated numbers to push the flu vaccine when the flu vaccine doesn’t reduce rates of pneumonia. And the insert actually lists pneumonia as a possible side effect. \n\nCochrane review\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/22895945/\n\nAnd...\n\nThe Myth of Herd Immunity\nThe Myth of Herd Immunity leads us to believe that unvaccinated populations will bring back epidemics of deadly diseases. This myth also makes us believe that:\n1. Unvaccinated children are a threat to society and\n2. Unvaccinated children pose a risk to vaccinated children.\nI’ll tackle this whole discombobulated mess of a myth in one post, through the research, knowledge, science, & expertise of a doctor, a pediatrician, & a neurosurgeon.\nWhat are we told?\n* We often hear statements from public health officials like “Clusters of unvaccinated children are not only in potential danger themselves, but are also a threat to the herd immunity”.\n* Authorities argue that parents should vaccinate their children to protect society as a whole from epidemics.\n* According to public health officials, “parents who reject vaccines don’t consider the effect of their child on the rest of society”.\n* We are told that for the shots to work, everyone must play along. And parents who decline the vaccines, are somehow reaping the benefits from those who are vaccinated.\nWhat is truth? \nDr. O’Shea, in his book: “Vaccination is Not Immunization” explains:  “Do not make the error of many pediatricians or journalists who talk about herd immunity as though it refers to the immunity that proceeds from a large group of people being vaccinated. The calculated deception behind this common misnomer is that if you don’t know what herd immunity is, you’ll buy their illusion: that the unvaccinated child can take advantage of the herd who have been vaccinated. This is well though-out propaganda. True herd immunity is a term which indicates that a disease has burned itself out within a population, as with plague, smallpox, typhus-every infectious disease in history. The herd has become immune. Natural selection. It has to do with nature, not with manmade vaccines. Don’t be fooled again”\nDr. Palevsky (board-certified pediatrician) explains: “This whole concept of herd immunity is very interesting, because we were taught that herd immunity occurs because a certain percentage of a population gets an active illness. Therefore by a certain percentage of getting the active illness, they impart a protection onto the remaining part of the population that has not gotten the illness yet. And so the herd that is getting the illness is shedding the illness and protecting those who have not gotten it.\"\nIn vaccine science, we are extrapolating or concluding that if we vaccinate a certain percentage of people, we are imparting protection on those who have not been vaccinated. And that has NOT been shown to be true, because the true herd immunity in theory is based on an ACTIVE DISEASE, and we know that despite what we’re taught, vaccination does not mimic the natural disease.\nThus, we cannot use the same model of herd immunity in a natural disease in the vaccination policy. This does not stop the press, every single year.\nThe entire concept of herd immunity fails to acknowledge that there is a life cycle of the viruses and the bacteria all on their own, and that what turns them on and off may have nothing to do with the percentage of people who have been infected.\nBy failing to include that viruses have a life cycle, and that they are in relationship to other organisms and to us, we are missing the main point. It is preposterous to think that a child who is vaccinated no longer carries the bacteria or the viruses that they have been vaccinated against. That is the whole point of vaccines.\nSo Once You Are Vaccinated, You Are Part of the Herd. Right?\nDr. Blaylock (board certified neurosurgeon) explains: \n“In the original description of herd immunity, the protection to the population at large occurred only if people contracted the infections naturally. The reason is that naturally acquired immunity lasts for a lifetime. Vaccine proponents quickly latched onto this concept and applied it to vaccine-induced immunity. But there was one major problem: Vaccine-induced immunity lasts for only a relatively short period…\nThis is why they quietly began to suggest  boosters for most vaccines, even the common childhood infections such as chickenpox, measles, mumps, and rubella.\nThen they discovered an even greater problem: The boosters were lasting for only two years or less. This is why we are now seeing mandates that youth entering colleges have multiple vaccines, even those that they insisted gave lifelong immunity, such as the MMR. The same is being suggested for full-grown adults. Ironically, no one in the media or medical field is asking what is going on. They just accept that it must be done.\nThat vaccine-induced herd immunity is mostly myth can be proven quite simply. We all were told for over 70 years that vaccine immunity lasts a lifetime. It was not until relatively recently that it was discovered that most of these vaccines lost their effectiveness 2 to 10 years after being given.\nWhat this means is that at least half the population, that is the baby boomers, have had no vaccine-induced immunity against any of these diseases for which they had been vaccinated very early in life. At least 50 percent of the population has been unprotected for decades.\nIf we listen to present-day wisdom, we are all at risk of resurgent massive epidemics should the vaccination rate fall below 95 percent. Yet we have all lived for at least 30 to 40 years with 50 percent or less of the population having vaccine protection.\nHerd immunity has not existed in this country for many decades, and no resurgent epidemics have occurred. Vaccine-induced herd immunity is a lie used to frighten doctors, public-health officials, other medical personnel, and the public into accepting vaccinations”.\nWhere is the Logic?\nTake Pertussis (whooping cough) Dr. Palevsky explains this very well:\nDo children vaccinated with the pertussis vaccine somehow stop carrying pertussis bacteria in their airways simply because they’ve been vaccinated? NO\nDo pertussis vaccines stop vaccinated children from transmitting the pertussis bacteria to other people? NO\nDo pertussis bacteria disappear from society once vaccination rates are high? NO: Vaccination rates for pertussis have no impact on whether the pertussis bacteria are in the air or not, or whether or not we breathe them in. The presence of the pertussis bacteria, and the exposure to them, are in no way affected by vaccination status or vaccination rates.\nDo unvaccinated children, because they are unvaccinated, carry the bacteria in their airways, which vaccinated children are somehow no longer believed to be carrying because they’ve been vaccinated? NO\nDo unvaccinated children transmit the pertussis bacteria to other children by the mere fact that they are not vaccinated? NO: Air is air. Air is free to breathe. We breathe in whatever is in the air. And, vaccinated and unvaccinated children are equally exposed to breathing in pertussis bacteria.\nAnyone who poses as science the idea that unvaccinated children pose a threat to the population because they are unvaccinated and are more likely to transmit a disease to the rest of the population, is misleading you, promulgating myth, and inaccurate. Vaccination with the pertussis vaccine does not exonerate anyone from carrying the pertussis bacteria, or prevent them from being exposed to the bacteria.\nUnvaccinated children do not walk around carrying secret viruses and bacteria that no-one else has. An unvaccinated child with measles has no greater chance of spreading measles than a vaccinated child with measles would.",

This happened because so many people said vaccines were injuring their loved ones.\n\nThe ethical argument against double-blind placebo controlled studies is nonsense. In drug trial (vs biologics aka vaccines) a sick individual would be denied a drug that could potentially save their life in order to have a true control to determine an accurate basis of side effects for risk assessment. And in vaccine trials they will not only use a different vaccine as the “placebo”, they will also use a solution with the aluminum adjuvants in place of a saline solution. How is this beneficial to anyone? How is it more ethical to expose someone to the most questionable ingredient in the vaccine with no benefit of generating any kind of antibodies? It’s total nonsense. \n\nAluminum does cross the blood brain barrier and accumulate in the body. \n\nThe study “Flarend et al.”  was a study of 6 rabbits over 28 days that looked at the absorption and elimination of Al adjuvants. \n\nThe study admits we do not understand Al adjuvants in the body. “The disposition of aluminum containing adjuvants after intramuscular administration is not understood.”\n\nThe study detected Al adjuvant in the brain, kidneys, spleen, liver, lymph nodes and heart.\n\nMost of Al still in the system after 28 days: “The cumulative amount of aluminum eliminated in the urine during the 28 days of the study was 6% of the Al hydroxide and 22% of the Al phosphate adjuvant dose. Aluminum from both adjuvants was still being excreted at a steady rate at day 28.”\n\nFor Al hydroxide, about 100-5.6% = 94.4% of the aluminum remained in the rabbits after 28 days. For Al phosphate, about 100-22% = 78% remained in the rabbits after 28 days. We do not know the elimination rates of the Al still in the body after 28 days or what happened to the Al that travelled to the brain and other organs. \n\nAl and macrophagic myofasciitis (MMF) lesion\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4318414/\n“We previously showed that poorly biodegradable aluminum-coated particles injected into muscle are promptly phagocytosed in muscle and the draining lymph nodes, and can disseminate within phagocytic cells throughout the body and slowly accumulate in brain.

   "body": "First of all, double blind studies need large masses of people and it's unethical. Like, if you give a placebo to some infants that could be saved from tetanus, diphtheria, hepatitis etc, would you do it? What if they die from that disease? \n\nhttps://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/94056/9789241506250_eng.pdf;jsessionid=D19837B6AAF49E362E4297F66EBB53E4?sequence=1\n\nExample for the rotavirus vaccine\n\n>A key ethical aspect considered when adopting the placebo-controlled design was that the risks of withholding rotavirus vaccine could be (and were) mitigated by rehydration counselling and regular check-ups. \n\n\nAnother problem with that is that these vaccines were proven over and over again that they are effective. And there are multiple methods to do that without risking someone's lives. Like testing for antibodies. It's simple, it's effective, it doesn't cost that much, especially not a life!\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4157320/\n\n>Against this backdrop, the WHO Department of Ethics and Social Determinants convened an expert consultation to provide recommendations on the use of placebo controls in vaccine trials in cases where an efficacious vaccine already exists. \n\nSee? It's not like the dropped the vaccines on the market and then let them do damage and hope for the best. The vaccines were extensively tested anyway, so yeah, now maybe they can have some placebo tests done, if it doesn't risk... let's say, an infant's life. But they don't even need to do that. They just have to use an unvaccinated cohort (and they can find that for sure, either because of poverty, lack of vaccines, etc) and compare the results.\n\n>While this paper focuses specifically on the use of placebo controls, similar considerations apply to open designs in which a placebo is not used, but an unvaccinated control group is included.\n\n\nAnother great article.\n\n\nhttps://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/blog/vaccine-randomized-clinical-trials\n\n\nFor the other thing: https://www.skepticalraptor.com/skepticalraptorblog.php/aluminum-and-vaccines-its-time-to-clear-up-the-pseudoscience/\n\nFirst it was \"mercury\" or thimerosal, which is a salt of mercury. Now it's aluminium. They're just moving goal posts. \n\nThe dose makes the poison. From a 0,5 ml dose of a vaccine, aluminium will not be in such a high quantity and it will be eliminated from the body within 72 h and wouldn't be able to travel anywhere, since it's injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly. \n\nIn fact, it stays there, irritates the skin, draws white blood cells to it and then will help create a higher immune response than a vaccine without it. That's it. \n\n\nDoesn't cross the brain's barrier, doesn't accumulate, doesn't do... whatever they claim today.\n\n\nPS: skeptical raptor is an MD and his blog has done many articles debunking their bullshit, with sources.",

   "body": "It's funny that. In England & Wales from 1901 to 1970 sudden and inexplicable deaths in under 4 year old's was a rarity with just a few cases per year. In 1961 the first measles vaccine was trialed here. 1961 saw a higher than ever reported morbidity of measles and a higher than average mortality, the 5 years prior to this we weren't even seeing 100 deaths per year which was quite the achievement given at the start of the century we were seeing up to >13,000 in a year, in 1961 we saw 152 deaths. 1962 they seemed to step back. No reports of any tests and the numbers showed it. Case rates plummeted, as did mortality. 1963, they officially star to use the first measles vaccine. Again, we see morbidity and mortality rise:\n\nYear\tCases\tDeaths\n\n1956\t160,556\t    28\n\n1957\t633,678\t    94\n\n1958\t259,308\t    49\n\n1959\t539,524\t    98\n\n1960\t159,364\t    31\n\n**1961\t763,531\t   152**\n\n1962\t184,895\t    39\n\n**1963\t601,255\t   127**\n\n**1964\t306,801\t    73**\n\n**1965\t502,209\t   115**\n\n**1966\t343,642\t    80**\n\n**1967\t460,407\t    99**\n\nIf you look at the history of measles mortality, you see a pattern develop - low then high. Over the decades, mortality bombed. No NHS, no antibiotics, no vaccine, just improved living and better understanding. When you look at 1956 to 1960 and compare that to how the drop was constant up until this point, there was nothing in nature that should have allowed mortality to rise the way it did, the **only** difference during these times was the measles vaccine. Mortality was almost double what it should have been during these times.\n\nIn 1968 an *improved* vaccine is released and measles rates settle. Uptake is slow, however, the interesting thing is the rise in sudden and inexplicable deaths in children under the age of 4 from 1970. Prior to 1970, there were 2, maybe 3 if any deaths in under 4's which couldn't be explained.\n\n**Sudden and unexplained deaths in under 4's:**\n\n**1961 -** 0\n\n**1962 -** 0\n\n**1963 -** 0\n\n**1964 -** 1\n\n**1965 -** 1\n\n**1966 -** 0\n\n**1967 -** 0\n\n**1968 -** 1\n\n**1969 -** 2\n\n**1970 -** 51\n\n**1971 -** 250\n\n**1972 -** 454\n\n**1973 -** 581\n\n**1974 -** 600\n\n**1975 -** 634\n\n**1976 -** 626\n\n**1977 -** 690\n\n**1978 -** 736\n\nIt got so bad, they even invented a syndrome.\n\n\"Vaccinated people live long enough to be adults and adults are meanies\" - sure, if you're lucky enough not to be killed and discarded as being just another unknown case of the mystery which is SIDS",

First, for two months of age, an unspecified developmental delay, which has its own specific ICD9 code. Exposure at three months of age, Tics. Exposure at six months of age, an attention deficit disorder. Exposure at one, three and six months of age, language and speech delays which are two separate ICD9 codes. Exposures at one, three and six months of age, the entire category of neurodevelopmental delays, which includes all of these plus a number of other disorders.”\n\n> Dr. Weil, pg. 207: \"The number of dose related relationships are linear and statistically significant. You can play with this all you want. They are linear. They are statistically significant. The positive relationships are those that one might expect from the Faroe Islands studies. They are also related to those data we do have on experimental animal data and similar to the neurodevelopmental tox data on other substances, so that I think you can't accept that this is out of the ordinary.

OP never claimed this, and you never explained why one might presuppose a static rate of ASD was reasonable to begin with.\n\nAnd *that* was what I was trying to tell you. ASD rates have changed independent of vaccines. You cannot look at one point in time and conclude anything. You insisting that OP said that is bad faith, since there is nothing to indicate that's what they meant, you never asked them about it, and there are plenty of reasonable interpretations on the table.\n\nI think you've now tried to walk it back to a more general rebuttal of something that, well, nobody suggested was the case to begin with.",

If you don't realize you're wrong, that's a different story, but since you don't bother justify how that's the case that is itself a *different* level of disingenuous argument. \n\nWe're multi-layered at this point because you have no apparent desire to do anything but argue for the sake of argument.

Elemental mercury isn't the same as organic mercury. If your only chemistry background was in high school or not even then, it's understandable that you may not fully understand this. \n\nMethanol, HOCH3, is extremely poisonous to humans on low doses. Ethanol, HO(CH3)2, so off by just a saturated carbon, is drinking alcohol. Not safe, but not poisonous at moderate doses. That's just a couple atoms. \n\nA better example might even be oxygen. Breathing in the oxygen you do, diatomic oxygen, O2, is MUCH different than elemental or ionic oxygen. One let's you live, the other rips apart DNA. That's just a couple electrons. \n\nThe best example, as always, is table salt. Sodium in it's elemental,uncharged, +0 state explodes in reaction with water. Chlorine in it's elemental, uncharged form is an incredibly poisonous gas. But guess what? When these are combined, or for specificty's sake, one electron is removed from each, they become a flavorful, harmless salt. That's one electron that separates an explosive sodium with a dissolvable sodium ion. \n\nIn that same spirit, the mercury that used to be in vaccines wasn't in elemental form. It was in this compound.\n https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Thiomersal.svg/1200px-Thiomersal.svg.png\n\nThat looks pretty complex, right? The way molecules are structured doesn't allow for atoms to \"be themselves\" when in a compound. Mercury here (in it's +2 state) can't do what we all know elemental mercury, or even worse, methylmercury, can do. It can't just break free and be a dangerous atom. The resonance forms from the ring as well as the heavy metal salt component make it a completely unique compound; not just the sum of its parts. It's much more complex than that. \n\nIf that's too confusing, I'm sorry. That's the way it is. Hope it helps",

Often cited are the National Childhood Encephalopathy Study conducted in UK from 1976 to 1979 and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report (1994). The initial findings of the National Encephalopathy study were that acute encephalopathy occurred at a rate of 1 per 310,000 to 5,300,000 doses (95% CI 54,000 to 5,310,000). Subsequent investigations and follow-up of the affected children then cast some doubt on these initial findings and demonstrated no increase in the rate of death or other sequelae after a DTwP vaccine (Edwards et al., 2008). However, despite these revised findings this has been an area of ongoing controversy. In 1994, the IOM concluded that “the balance of evidence is consistent with a causal relationship between DTwP and chronic nervous system dysfunction in children whose serious acute neurological illness occurred within 7 days of a DTwP vaccination”. This may imply that the vaccine rarely may trigger such an event in an individual who may be predisposed to develop such a condition because of an underlying abnormality. The IOM committee concluded that the evidence is insufficient to indicate either the presence or absence of a causal relationship between DTwP vaccine and permanent neurological damage (Cowan et al.,1993). More recent studies do not confirm an association between DTwP and acute encephalopathy. A population-based case-control study has evaluated the association between serious acute neurological illness and receipt of whole-cell pertussis vaccine, given as diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTwP) vaccine. The estimated odds ratio for children with encephalopathy or complicated seizures was 3.6 (95% CI, 0.8 to 15.2). The study concluded that there was no statistically significant increased risk of serious acute neurological illness in the 7 days after DTwP vaccine exposure (Gale et al., 1994). A retrospective case-control study performed at four health maintenance organizations by examining children aged 0 to 6 years who were hospitalized with encephalopathy or related conditions determined that cases were no more likely than controls to have received a DTwP vaccine during the 90 days before disease onset. When encephalopathy of known etiology was excluded, the odds ratio for case children having received DTP within 7 days before onset of disease was 1.22 (95% CI, 0.45-3.31, P = 0.693) compared with control children. The study concluded that DTwP vaccination was not associated with an increased risk of encephalopathy (Ray et al., 2006).",

But those memory cells don't live forever. Some can live up to 10-15 years but that's all. That's why it's important to reinject the vaccine so memory cells can be created once again.",

Both prior to vaccine campaigns and after unadjuvanted vaccination, respectively. And by \"handful\" exactly how many cases are you suggesting happened in Europe following Pandemrix vaccination compared with China/Taiwan? You keep using spin despite your apparent disdain for it.\n\n>No cases in Europe like that. They were all associated with the vaccine, not the virus.\n\nOnly Pandemrix, and there is no current hypothesis in which the vaccine was a risk factor *outside of* viral antigen (not specific to the vaccine) or other concurrent environmental factors (e.g. H1N1 infection, GAS).\n\n>About 1300 cases.

This would explain the apparent presence of an association in Finland, Sweden and Norway where wildtype virus circulated coincident with the vaccination program, whereas no association was seen in Ontario where wild-type virus was no longer circulating at the time of the vaccination program.\n\nYou also are greatly exaggerating the numbers of those with NT1 narcolepsy relative to the overall risk.

It's also not used in the US, either, because there isn't a need for it. It's just used for pandemic vaccines in emergent circumstances.\n\n>You can spin it how you want. An interplay of vaccine and genetics really screwed these people.\n\nThere's no spin, just fact. But since you live and breathe off spin and lies, I'm not surprised you recognize a different consistency here. You've gone waaay off the beaten path because you don't know shit about immunology, ASD pathogenesis, or infectious disease. So you found that one discontinued vaccine increased the risk of narcolepsy/cataplexy in a subset of genetically disposed individuals and you're trying to run hard with it.\n\nIt has nothing to do with childhood vaccines, nothing to do with ASD, and likely nothing to do with AS03. That there was an association with the vaccine is incidental and due to the fact that it was, apparently, able to recapitulate the natural tendency of some circulating pandemic 2009 H1N1 strains to increase rates of narcolepsy/cataplexy. To repeat: **circulating H1N1 virus was correlated with increased narcolepys/cataplexy rates prior to vaccine campaigns in several countries**.\n\nCryptic antigen mimicry which is the presumed mechanism of action is likely at play in several diseases. If we can determine the B or T cell epitopes with cross reactivity these can be removed from the vaccine. As it currently stands, these epitopes were never determined. Nevertheless, you will still run to such edge cases with relatively small impacts on small incidence rates because this is how you behave when you've been cornered. You repeat this pattern over and over, much to the amusement of onlookers. \n\n>Maybe you should go back to playing with next year's flu vax formulation.\n\nI don't make flu vaccines or any vaccine.\n\n>You know, make it really work this time.\n\nIt's working this time and worked last time.

We have [data](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/addm-community-report/differences-in-children.html) on that. It doesn't support your hypothesis--that non-white ethnicities have higher ASD diagnosis. So we keep piling up the implausibility. You have to now plausibly explain why higher antibody titers or other unknown immune response factors to a vaccine lead to differential ASD diagnosis among races. And *then* you have to explain why in *your* link there is no difference among genders--which is a hallmark for differential ASD diagnosis. Oops, guess ya didn't read that after all.\n\nSo, yes, I'm curious: how would race, but not gender, impact ASD development according to the above link when this 1) doesn't fit epi data on ASD diagnosis among ethnicities; 2) doesn't fit gender epi data on ASD diagnosis? But we know the answer: you haven't thought about it and you don't care. You just bring up some random hair-brained idea to deal with your cognitive dissonance. The pattern has borne itself out twice in this thread alone.\n\n>I'm \"caucasian\". I've also found out I have fairly recent genetic ties to subsaharan Africa.\n\nExcellent--so this would *not* be a problem with the Danish study, as genetic factors can be cryptic and not adequately accounted for by simple race-binning. High five!\n\n>That was a pretty big fuckup too, wasn't it? One in five europeans carrying a dormant gene for narcolepsy that the vaccine adjuvant just happened to trigger?\n\nUh oh, sounds like you don't know much about AS03, MF59, or the Pandemrix situation and that this is just a random distraction from the actual conversation you've so thoroughly lost. No worries--I'm used to having to fill you in on everything.\n\nThe Pandemrix association with narcolepsy appears to be a cryptic antigen site, not related to any of the adjuvants used in the pandemic vaccines. Read the [multi-country](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6404226/) assessment which looked at several AS03 and one MF59 vaccine, as well as the safety assessment of [AS03](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X19305225?via%3Dihub). \n\nAlso, you don't seem to understand how genes work. The vaccine didn't trigger a \"dormant gene\". The virus, which the vaccine recapitulated specific antigenic sites, can apparently trigger autoimmune reaction in a small subset of people among a specific HLA type. I recommend hitting up wikipedia on [genes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene) so you can get that under your belt. \n\nYou're lucky I grade on a curve, bucko. See, OP? He don't know anything.

You see, vaccines help greatly and they actually help you prevent death(not 100% but more than those who are unvaccinated) . They have rid the world of polio and other uncommon or no longer existing diseases. There is also actual scientific evidence that vaccines work. And the \"vaccines cause autism\" thing? Yeah, caused by a doctor who paid kids at his sons birthday party to give blood, manipulated data, and sold the false findings for money. Correct me if im wrong, but sme like you are pro vaccine.

But they share the common physical symptoms of rash & fever.\n\nAnd they also don't share other pathologies, hence the distinction being important from a public heath standpoint. You keep ignoring this.\n\n>You taught me that the pathogenic strain can cause further complications like SSPE. According to the CDC, severe complications are rare. Pneumonia is said to be 1 in 20.\n\nDeath is about 1-2 per 1000 for wild-type measles, as well as immune repertoire depletion, deafness, pneumonia you mention, encephahlitis you mention. This doesn't happen with the vaccine component.\n\n>The studies show 40-50% of kids got upper respiratory infections and gastro-intestinal disorders after the MMR vaccine.\n\nLink it if you want me to consider it in our discussion.\n\n>That's a harsh trade-off for a virus that causes rash & fever in the common person\n\nAnd would kill thousands annually unnecessarily, along with the sequelae we've mentioned previously. But, sure, let's equate increased risk of a cold with measles pathology.\n\n>and then gives you lifelong immunity.\n\nYou can get lifelong immunity *and* avoid the disease with vaccines. Immunity isn't the goal--avoiding the disease and its ramifications is.\n\n>Unless you're immunocompromised, no reason to be scared of wild measles.\n\nWe've literally mentioned excellent reasons, such as the unnecessary deaths of thousands and other bad sequelae. All of which has disappeared from the US due to vaccination. \n\n>Your argument is that these vaccinees were not infected with measles. They simply had the EXACT SAME PHYSICAL REACTION as the people that DID catch the measles at the SAME TIME & LOCATION of a measles outbreak?\n\nThat's not my argument--that's what your study says. They didn't have the exact same physical reaction, they had a fever and rash. They were not shedding measles virus, they were potentially shedding attenuated measles vaccine virus. They were not having a risk of pneumonia, encephalitis, or death. They were having an uncommon reaction to the vaccine strain.\n\n>Maybe entertain the possibility of primary & secondary vaccine failure. Or viral shedding from other recent vaccinees. Your faith in this vaccine is strong my friend.\n\nVaccination failure exists. The solution is to titer and re-vaccinate, or rely on herd immunity.\n\nAs for shedding from recent vaccinees, they'd be shedding attenuated vaccine virus. Which, again, is not pathogenic.\n\nThere's no faith at play here.\n\n>Now the 1999 pilot. You got this wrong. And I'm the one that doesn't know how to read?\n\nEither unable or unwilling, yes.\n\n>Actually they looked at less data. The 1999 unpublished pilot looked at 400,000 infants in the VSD. Phase I of the 2004 published study only looked at 124,170 infants in the VSD.\n\nAh, here's that inability to read again. Let's fact check this bit.\n\n>>We assessed the risk for neurologic and renal impairment associated with past exposure to thimerosal-containing vaccine using automated data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD). VSD is a large linked database from four health maintenance organizations in Washington, Oregon and California, containing immunization, medical visit and demographic data on over 400,000 infants born between '91 and '97.\n\nThere are 400,000 infants in the VSD. That doesn't mean all were appropriate or selected for in their analysis. So you're already off base here. But it gets better.\n\n>>A 2-phased retrospective cohort study was\nconducted using computerized health maintenance organization (HMO) databases. Phase I screened for associations between neurodevelopmental disorders and thimerosal exposure among 124 170 infants who were born during\n1992 to 1999 at 2 HMOs (A and B). In phase II, the most\ncommon disorders associated with exposure in phase I\nwere reevaluated among 16 717 children who were born\nduring 1991 to 1997 in another HMO (C). Relative risks\nfor neurodevelopmental disorders were calculated per\nincrease of 12.5 g of estimated cumulative mercury exposure from TCVs in the first, third, and seventh months\nof life\n\nSo, no, they didn't use a smaller sample size. The exact inclusion criteria of the abstract presented isn't known, since only the abstract has been saved. And, no, phase II doesn't use a smaller sample size or remove the first. It is a comparison of a different HMO investigating rates found in the first two HMOs. And there was no association. And, finally, this study (both phases) looks at the 1st, 3rd, and 7th month of life whereas the initial abstract is just about the first month.\n\nThis is also evident when you look at the sheer number of disorders found in the full paper's phase I as it clearly outnumbers the total of all disorders of the abstract. \n\nSo my advice: work on that reading comprehension. You've got some words down, but the ability to interpret meaning is tripping you up.\n\n>Wrong again. In phase II, the most common disorders associated with exposure in phase I were re-evaluated among only 16,717 children.\n\nNo, all associations and RR of significance in phase I were analyzed at a different site. It's not the \"most common\" but those with apparent RR of concern.\n\n>It's so obvious that they reduced the sample size to make the links to autism, sleep disorders, learning disabilities and speech delays in the 1999 pilot statistically less significant.\n\nHow so? The sample size of the abstract isn't known. The paper has a combined sample size of 140,887. The significance of phase I isn't removed by addition of a *smaller* sample size. That makes no sense at all. Do you not understand how that makes no sense?\n\n>Furthermore, there's a massive ethical issue with the 1999 study. If you're the CDC, and you find data that points to a 762% increase in autism after the Hep B shot, you have a duty to disclose that to the public. The CDC is the health protection agency of the nation.\n\nWhich they investigated. And found no apparent significance at different HMOs. And recommended further study with larger samples and consistent diagnostic criteria. In no way were the results buried. \n\n>Instead, they hid the study. Then 5 years later, they reduce the sample sizes and publish a study \"proving\" everything was safe all along.\n\nYou're living in a fantasy land. They published the study. You (claim) to have read it yourself.\n\n>Thanks again for turning me onto the 2004 study.\n\nNo problem. Keep hitting the books. Read them, also, but keep hitting them, too.",

I'm going to explain myself again and capitalize the important words. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"...recipients of measles virus-containing vaccine EXPERIENCE RASH AND FEVER which may be INDISTINGUISHABLE from measles.\" [Source](https://jcm.asm.org/content/55/3/735)  \n>  \n>\"We report a 1-year-old boy who, 10 days after vaccination, DEVELOPED VACCINE MEASLES which was CLINICALLY INDISTINGUISHABLE from the natural  disease.\" [Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15804301?dopt=Abstract)\n\nClinically indistinguishable means that when OBSERVING the patient, the PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS (rash & fever) can look the same in BOTH wild strain and vaccine strain measles.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Vaccine strain isn't the same as the pathogenic strain. This isn't scary  for anyone except those undergoing chemotherapy and other immune-depleting situations.\n\nTrue. They differ on a genetic level. But they share the common physical symptoms of rash & fever. You taught me that the pathogenic strain can cause further complications like SSPE. According to the CDC, severe complications are rare. Pneumonia is said to be 1 in 20. That doesn't look bad when compared to the MMR II pre-licensing studies that got released this week. The studies show 40-50% of kids got upper respiratory infections and gastro-intestinal disorders after the MMR vaccine. That's a harsh trade-off for a virus that causes rash & fever in the common person and then gives you lifelong immunity. Unless you're immunocompromised, no reason to be scared of wild measles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Of the 194 measles virus sequences obtained in the United States in 2015, 73 were identified as vaccine sequences\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Those recent vaccinees were not infected with measles. They simply had a  relatively common reaction to the vaccination and, due to proximity  (locale and time) with an actual measles   outbreak, were initial  false-positives.\n\nYour argument is that these vaccinees were not infected with measles. They simply had the EXACT SAME PHYSICAL REACTION as the people that DID catch the measles at the SAME TIME & LOCATION of a measles outbreak? \n\nMaybe entertain the possibility of primary & secondary vaccine failure. Or viral shedding from other recent vaccinees. Your faith in this vaccine is strong my friend. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow the 1999 pilot. You got this wrong. And I'm the one that doesn't know how to read? \n\n>More data can do that. Weird how sample sizes work?\n\nActually they looked at less data. The 1999 unpublished pilot looked at 400,000 infants in the VSD. Phase I of the 2004 published study only looked at 124,170 infants in the VSD. \n\n>Yep. Bigger sample size.\n\nWrong again. In phase II, the most common disorders associated with exposure in phase I were re-evaluated among only 16,717 children.\n\nIt's so obvious that they reduced the sample size to make the links to autism, sleep disorders, learning disabilities and speech delays in the 1999 pilot statistically less significant. Then they reduced it again. Wow.  This is the same strategy Dr. William Thompson said he used with his team to bury the autism link during the famous 2004 MMR study. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, there's a massive ethical issue with the 1999 study. If you're the CDC, and you find data that points to a 762% increase in autism after the Hep B shot, you have a duty to disclose that to the public. The CDC is the health protection agency of the nation. \n\nThey had multiple options: \n\nHold a press conference and re-assure the public that a further study would be done immediately. (This study analyzed existing data in the VSD so they could literally have done this study with a computer in a few hours). \n\nRemove the Hep B vaccine indefintely for non-risk newborns until further study was completed. Only administer it to at-risk newborns if their mother tested positive for Hep B during pregnancy. It is a vaccine for a sexually transmitted disease given on the first day of life. It would have made zero difference. \n\nEither option would would have built public trust and strengthened the vaccine program. \n\nInstead, they hid the study. Then 5 years later, they reduce the sample sizes and publish a study \"proving\" everything was safe all along. \n\nFortunately for us, the FOIA request has exposed the unpublished 1999 pilot. Now, the CDC loses credibility, and confirms people's suspicions that it cares more about protecting pharma profits and the reputation of vaccines than children's health. \n\nThanks again for turning me onto the 2004 study. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

   "body": ">The information I provided is not wrong\n\nYou've repeatedly said nonsensical and incorrect statements as well as ludicrous conclusions from otherwise innocuous sources. Some of your links are fine. Your ability to interpret them is supremely bad.\n\n>This proves that the measles outbreak was in part caused by the vaccine.\n\nIt proves you don't know how to read. The outbreak in California was caused by the Phillipines strain as already referenced. What the paper you *just* referenced is talking about is the ability to discriminate between vaccine measles strains and pathogenic measles strains. Your source goes on to say:\n\n>>Since approximately 5% of recipients of measles virus-containing vaccine experience rash and fever which may be indistinguishable from measles (9), it is very important to identify vaccine reactions to avoid unnecessary isolation of the patient, as well as the need for contact tracing and other labor-intensive public health interventions.\n\nAnd the part you liked to leave out, because you are dishonest and in over your head:\n\n>>Of the 194 measles virus sequences obtained in the United States in 2015, 73 were identified as vaccine sequences (R. J. McNall, unpublished data). \n\n>>Genotyping is used to confirm the origin of an outbreak and to exclude endemic circulation, but it is also the only way to distinguish vaccine strains from wild-type viruses. \n\nThose recent vaccinees were not infected with measles. They simply had a relatively common reaction to the vaccination and, due to proximity (locale and time) with an actual measles outbreak, were initial false-positives.\n\n>McNall contradicts that by explaining that vaccine strain reaction (rash & fever) is clinically indistinguishable from the natural disease.\n\nNo they don't. How else, then, can the PCR test distinguish them if they are indistinguishable? How else, then, do public health authorities justify quarantine for those with measles rather than vaccination reactions? You know, like McNall says here:\n\n>>During measles outbreak investigations, rapid detection of measles vaccine reactions is necessary to avoid unnecessary public health interventions.\n\nAnd also in **the first line of the paper**:\n\n>>During measles outbreaks, it is important to be able to rapidly distinguish between measles cases and vaccine reactions to avoid unnecessary outbreak response measures such as case isolation and contact investigations. \n\n>and CDC stating that the reaction of vaccine strain and wild strain is identical\n\nThey don't. Even in *your source* they are clearly distinguishable. The measles component is twice attenuated and not pathogenic. It can cause a rash and fever. It does not cause CNS damage, immune repertoire depletion, or SSPE--hallmarks of pathogenic measles. \n\n>Also, thank you for showing me the 2004 Thimerosal study. You've uncovered something interesting.\n\nWait, you mean the study that was only accessed by FOIA and was buried by the CDC, never to be released to the public? Yeah, imagine that...\n\n>The 1999 study\n\nExcept it's a pilot study given a presentation. It wasn't a paper yet. Further data collection resulted in a complete study, published in 2004.\n\n>Oddly, the 2004 continuation study is the exact opposite. Titled Safety of Thimerosal-Containing Vaccines: A Two-Phased Study of Computerized Health Maintenance Organization Databases.\n\nMore data can do that. Weird how sample sizes work?\n\n>In this \"Phase II\" study, they've re-analyzed the Phase I data and suddenly found no increased risks for autism or attention-deficit disorder.\n\nYep. Bigger sample size. \n\n>Conclusions. No consistent significant associations were found between TCVs and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Conflicting results were found at different HMOs for certain outcomes. For resolving the conflicting findings, studies with uniform neurodevelopmental assessments of children with a range of cumulative thimerosal exposures are needed.\n\nNext question for ya: what was the follow up result? Spoiler: you're going to be disappointed.\n\n>I have a feeling that you regard everything the CDC reports as unquestionably true\n\nYour feelings seem to be based on nothing but nonsense, as evidenced by the complete 180s you've been doing this whole conversation. \n\n>In 1999, CDC conducted their study, found incredibly concerning data, and instead of making it public, they decided not to publish.\n\nThey published that study...you just \"read\" it. And by \"read\" of course we mean you skimmed the abstract. \n\n>In 2004, they published the continuation study that suddenly found that thimerosal was safe all along.\n\nOh, OK. That and, I suppose, FDA testing showing ethylmercury doesn't have the safety profile it was assumed to have (i.e. worse than methylmercury). Read the testimony to congress. The concern was that ethylmercury was expected to be *worse* than methylmercury. And, lo and behold, it's not.\n\nAnything else? Anything you've maybe actually read?",
