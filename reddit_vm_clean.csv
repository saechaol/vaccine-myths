complications pneumonia transmission cdc combines pneumonia rates flu rates estimate number deaths flu creating extremely exaggerated numbers push flu vaccine flu vaccine reduce rates pneumonia insert actually lists pneumonia possible side effect cochrane review and myth herd immunity myth herd immunity leads us believe unvaccinated populations bring back epidemics deadly diseases myth also makes us believe that    1 unvaccinated children threat society 2 unvaccinated children pose risk vaccinated children i will tackle whole discombobulated mess myth one post research knowledge science expertise doctor pediatrician neurosurgeon told often hear statements public health officials like clusters unvaccinated children not potential danger themselves also threat herd immunity authorities argue parents vaccinate children protect society whole epidemics according public health officials parents reject vaccines consider effect child rest society told shots work everyone must play along parents decline vaccines somehow reaping benefits vaccinated truth dr o hea book    vaccination not immunization explains    do not make error many pediatricians journalists talk herd immunity though refers immunity proceeds large group people vaccinated calculated deception behind common misnomer know herd immunity is buy illusion    unvaccinated child take advantage herd vaccinated well though out propaganda true herd immunity term indicates disease burned within population plague smallpox typhus every infectious disease history herd become immune natural selection nature not manmade vaccines fooled again dr palevsky board certified pediatrician explains    this whole concept herd immunity interesting taught herd immunity occurs certain percentage population gets active illness therefore certain percentage getting active illness impart protection onto remaining part population not gotten illness yet herd getting illness shedding illness protecting not gotten it vaccine science extrapolating concluding vaccinate certain percentage people imparting protection not vaccinated not shown true true herd immunity theory based active disease know despite we are taught vaccination not mimic natural disease thus cannot use model herd immunity natural disease vaccination policy not stop press every single year entire concept herd immunity fails acknowledge life cycle viruses bacteria own turns may nothing percentage people infected failing include viruses life cycle relationship organisms us missing main point preposterous think child vaccinated no longer carries bacteria viruses vaccinated against whole point vaccines vaccinated part herd right dr blaylock board certified neurosurgeon explains    in original description herd immunity protection population large occurred people contracted infections naturally reason naturally acquired immunity lasts lifetime vaccine proponents quickly latched onto concept applied vaccine induced immunity one major problem    vaccine induced immunity lasts relatively short period quietly began suggest boosters vaccines even common childhood infections chickenpox measles mumps rubella discovered even greater problem    boosters lasting two years less seeing mandates youth entering colleges multiple vaccines even insisted gave lifelong immunity mmr suggested full grown adults ironically no one media medical field asking going on accept must done vaccine induced herd immunity mostly myth proven quite simply told 70 years vaccine immunity lasts lifetime not relatively recently discovered vaccines lost effectiveness 10 years given means least half population baby boomers no vaccine induced immunity diseases vaccinated early life least 50 percent population unprotected decades listen present day wisdom risk resurgent massive epidemics vaccination rate fall 95 percent yet lived least 30 40 years 50 percent less population vaccine protection herd immunity not existed country many decades no resurgent epidemics occurred vaccine induced herd immunity lie used frighten doctors public health officials medical personnel public accepting vaccinations logic take pertussis whooping cough dr palevsky explains well    children vaccinated pertussis vaccine somehow stop carrying pertussis bacteria airways simply they have vaccinated no pertussis vaccines stop vaccinated children transmitting pertussis bacteria people no pertussis bacteria disappear society vaccination rates high no    vaccination rates pertussis no impact whether pertussis bacteria air not whether not breathe in presence pertussis bacteria exposure them no way affected vaccination status vaccination rates unvaccinated children unvaccinated carry bacteria airways vaccinated children somehow no longer believed carrying they have vaccinated no unvaccinated children transmit pertussis bacteria children mere fact not vaccinated no    air air air free breathe breathe whatever air and vaccinated unvaccinated children equally exposed breathing pertussis bacteria anyone poses science idea unvaccinated children pose threat population unvaccinated likely transmit disease rest population misleading you promulgating myth inaccurate vaccination pertussis vaccine not exonerate anyone carrying pertussis bacteria prevent exposed bacteria unvaccinated children not walk around carrying secret viruses bacteria no one

proposito de los comentarios que leido escuchado sobre las vacunas para el covid pero sobre todo de la vacuna rusa sputnik v dado la tarea de estudiar algunos textos cientificos hacer una compilacion de los mismos para hacerlos de su conocimiento continuacion les comparto sobre la vacuna rusa sputnik v lancet una de las revistas medicas mas prestigiosas del mundo publico los resultados de los ensayos de la primera la segunda fase de la vacuna rusa sputnik v que demostraron lo siguiente    1 la plataforma de vectores adenovirales humanos es eficaz pesar de las preocupaciones por la posibilidad de una inmunidad preexistente los adenovirus 2 se selecciono la dosis segura optima que permitio lograr una respuesta inmunitaria humoral celular en el 100 de los participantes incluso en aquellos que habian tenido una infeccion con adenovirus 3 el uso de dos vectores diferentes permite lograr una respuesta inmune mas efectiva 4 el nivel de anticuerpos contra el sars cov 2 en voluntarios vacunados con sputnik fue entre 1 4 1 5 veces mas alto que el nivel de anticuerpos en los pacientes que se habian recuperado del covid 5 tiene una eficacia de 91 4 por ciento contra el virus sars cov 2 de 100 por ciento para evitar los cuadros graves de la enfermedad covid al mismo tiempo no se encontraron eventos adversos graves en los vacunados con sputnik v mientras que para otras vacunas este parametro oscila entre el el 25 por ciento varias otras empresas estan utilizando tambien plataformas basadas en vectores adenovirales humanos para sus vacunas contra el covid como por ejemplo johnson johnson que usa el vector ad26 la china cansino que emplea el ad5 mientras que la rusa sputnik utiliza dos vectores adenovirales el ad5 el ad26 vale la pena mencionar que las plataformas para vacunas que usan otros paises como el vector de adenovirus de chimpance oxford astra zeneca quienes por cierto estan estudiando la posibilidad de aplicar de manera conjunta su vacuna la sputnik para incrementar su efectividad la tecnologia de arn pfizer biontech nunca antes habian sido utilizadas en vacunas que hayan pasado la fase 3 tampoco han sido sometidas estudios largo plazo sobre sus posibles efectos secundarios en el cuerpo humano como por ejemplo los riesgos de desarrollar complicaciones relacionadas con el cancer sus efectos sobre la fertilidad las vacunas de arn mensajero pfizer biontech moderna la mayor preocupacion con este tipo de vacunas ha sido su inestabilidad su baja eficiencia para introducirlas en las celulas que expresen el antigeno tambien ha preocupado el hecho de que el arn puede estimular reacciones inmunologicas de tipo inflamatorio por lo que todos estos factores han limitado en parte su desarrollo el arn es una molecula muy inestable que requiere condiciones de mantenimiento extremas de menos 80 se degrada muy facilmente por enzimas no se internaliza de forma eficiente sin embargo esta tecnologia tambien tiene ventajas es relativamente mas barata que otro tipo de vacunas y sobre todo permite disenar una vacuna nueva en un tiempo record una vez que se conoce el genoma del patogeno en unas semanas se pueden producir los primeros prototipos vacunales lo que la convierte en una excelente herramienta cuando aparece un patogeno nuevo para el que se necesita una vacuna con urgencia como en una pandemia en este caso la rapidez es un beneficio mayor que el problema de su inestabilidad moderna fue capaz de disenar su vacuna de arnm contra sars cov 2 tan solo seis semanas despues de que el genoma del virus se hiciera publico mi opinion por un lado la vacuna rusa aprovecha los modelos de vacunas ya probados innova en el sentido de usar dos vectores en lugar de uno solo es un modelo que si bien no tiene la efectividad que manifiestan en las vacunas de arn mensajero es mas segura en terminos de efectos secundarios adversos igual de efectiva que la vacunas que todos conocemos hasta ahora que nos hemos aplicado por el otro lado pfizer otras le apuestan al futuro lo economico puede que en esta ocasion tengan tropezones pero el avance que van lograr es un ahorro en anos de investigacion aun asi como el resto de las vacunas el reto sera que en el mediano largo plazo resulten eficaces que sus efectos adversos sean minimos para poder compararlas con el modelo tradicional de vacunas que guste no politicos villamelones es eficaz seguro conclusion encuentro optimista las vacunas contra el covid comentadas en este texto han demostrado cientificamente que podemos seguir confiando en la ciencia para resolver prevenir problemas de salud como las pandemias la competencia entre cientificos es sana provoca desarrollos alternativos lo que nos permite tener varias respuestas un mismo problema con ello se abran posibilidades para tomar decisiones que de acuerdo cada pais pueden ser mas adecuadas para cada uno guerra fria en pleno siglo xxi fuentes 1 y2qj7ydnhcfxg97uypoy 2 3 imagen    creador    klubovy imagen propiedad de    getty images copyright    klubovy,-1

said 20 death 1 2 per 1000 wild type measles well immune repertoire depletion deafness pneumonia mention encephahlitis mention happen vaccine component the studies show 40 50 kids got upper respiratory infections gastro intestinal disorders mmr vaccine link want consider discussion that harsh trade off virus causes rash fever common person would kill thousands annually unnecessarily along sequelae we have mentioned previously but sure let equate increased risk cold measles pathology and gives lifelong immunity get lifelong immunity and avoid disease vaccines immunity goal avoiding disease ramifications is unless immunocompromised no reason scared wild measles we have literally mentioned excellent reasons unnecessary deaths thousands bad sequelae disappeared us due vaccination your argument vaccinees not infected measles simply exact physical reaction people catch measles time location measles outbreak that not argument that study says exact physical reaction fever rash not shedding measles virus potentially shedding attenuated measles vaccine virus not risk pneumonia encephalitis death uncommon reaction vaccine strain maybe entertain possibility primary secondary vaccine failure viral shedding recent vaccinees faith vaccine strong friend vaccination failure exists solution titer re vaccinate rely herd immunity shedding recent vaccinees they would
