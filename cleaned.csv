2 en voluntarios vacunados_con sputnik fue entre 1 4 1 5 veces m_s alto que_el nivel_de anticuerpos en_los pacientes que_se hab_an recuperado del covid 5 tiene una eficacia de 91 4 por_ciento contra_el virus sars -_cov - 2 de 100 por_ciento para evitar los cuadros graves de_la enfermedad covid al mismo tiempo no_se encontraron eventos adversos graves en_los vacunados_con sputnik_v mientras_que para otras vacunas este par metro oscila entre el el 25 por_ciento varias otras empresas est_n utilizando tambi_n plataformas basadas en vectores_adenovirales humanos para sus vacunas_contra el_covid como_por ejemplo johnson_johnson que usa el_vector ad26 la china cansino que emplea el_ad5 mientras_que la rusa_sputnik utiliza dos_vectores adenovirales el_ad5 el ad26 vale la pena mencionar que las plataformas para vacunas_que usan otros pa ses como_el vector de adenovirus de chimpanc oxford -

biontech - moderna la mayor preocupaci n_con este tipo_de vacunas ha sido su_inestabilidad su baja eficiencia para introducirlas en_las c lulas que expresen el ant geno tambi_n ha preocupado el hecho de_que el_arn puede estimular reacciones inmunol gicas de tipo inflamatorio por lo_que todos estos factores han limitado en parte su desarrollo el_arn es una mol cula muy inestable que requiere condiciones de mantenimiento extremas de menos 80 se degrada muy f cilmente por enzimas no_se internaliza de forma eficiente sin embargo esta tecnolog_a tambi_n tiene ventajas es relativamente m_s barata que otro tipo_de vacunas y sobre_todo permite dise_ar una_vacuna nueva en un tiempo r cord una vez que_se conoce el_genoma del pat_geno en unas semanas se pueden producir los primeros prototipos vacunales lo_que la convierte en_una excelente herramienta cuando aparece un pat_geno nuevo para_el que_se necesita una_vacuna con urgencia como en_una pandemia en_este caso la rapidez es_un beneficio mayor que_el problema de_su inestabilidad moderna fue capaz de dise_ar su_vacuna de arnm contra sars -_cov - 2 tan solo seis semanas despu s de_que el_genoma del virus se hiciera p blico mi opini_n por un lado la_vacuna rusa aprovecha los modelos de_vacunas ya probados innova en_el sentido de usar dos_vectores en lugar de uno solo es_un modelo que si bien no tiene la efectividad que manifiestan en_las vacunas_de arn_mensajero es m_s segura en t rminos de efectos_secundarios adversos igual de efectiva que_la vacunas_que todos conocemos hasta ahora que_nos hemos aplicado por el otro lado pfizer otras le apuestan al futuro lo econ mico puede que_en esta ocasi n tengan tropezones pero el avance que van lograr es_un ahorro en a os de investigaci n a n as como_el resto de_las vacunas el reto ser que_en el mediano largo_plazo resulten eficaces que sus_efectos adversos sean m nimos para poder compararlas con_el modelo tradicional de_vacunas que guste no pol ticos villamelones es_eficaz seguro conclusi n me encuentro optimista las_vacunas contra_el covid comentadas en_este texto han demostrado cient ficamente que podemos seguir confiando en la ciencia para resolver prevenir problemas de salud como las pandemias la competencia entre cient_ficos es sana provoca desarrollos alternativos lo_que nos permite tener varias respuestas un mismo problema con ello se abran posibilidades para tomar decisiones que de acuerdo cada pa s pueden ser m_s adecuadas para cada uno guerra fr a en pleno siglo xxi fuentes 1 https_: www_thelancet com piis0140_- 6736_20 fulltext https_: www_thelancet com_journals lancet_article piis0140_- 6736_20 31866 -

when people_realized dtp caused brain_damage cases 80s people speculated could manifest autism could started that leo kanner first described autism 1944 noted one_autistic children became autistic month smallpox vaccine evidence vaccine caused_autism make connection,0
where idea start,0
well yes technically isn_t safe but is you literally_die oxygen yet live it,0
she not swayed and look factual evidence provide apparently facebook memes qualified doctors,0
he got license_back one doctor helped study lost_license fought get_back without_much battle able get_back,0
the formaldehyde think concern dosage vaccine still cannot assume anything safe_eat safe_inject valid argument without addressing specific effects chemical,0
it somewhat silly say meaningless for instance antivaxxers say formaldehyde vaccines they usually even give dosage the op gave dosage compared bananas then complain op failed make adjustment much formaldehyde bananas not absorbed since most formaldehyde absorbed gi tract https_: www atsdr cdc_gov mmg mmg asp id_= 216 tid = 39 seems picking straws,0
however_scientists studied_dosages substances_vaccines found_safe low_amounts used that may true_comparison still meaningless,0
and course worked already centre children_bowel problems_behavioural difficulties it not like encountered random children two_things mmr common and mmr already vaccine given standard children simply_saying i_have found 12_children bowel_problems behavioural problems given mmr proves nothing there_no control_group it like doctor clinic deaf children diabetes saying i_have found children deafness_diabetes issued birth_certificates therefore birth_certificates cause deafness_diabetes,0
you right analogy not perfect injection_ingestion different_effects ingested foods often partially absorbed blood stream however_scientists studied_dosages substances_vaccines found_safe low_amounts used,0
the comparison amount food amount vaccines good injection_ingestion different_effects body cases also aluminum adjuvant not preservative,0

yes bitch shill went opposite direction said are retarded them,0
no repeated already_said the poster pointed specific questions even try answer them,0
youre idiot gave exact answer,0
so_answer questions non answers chasing tail around,0
people not natural_immunity get diseases edit scaredy cats,0
the titer test tests antobodies certain disease see immunity it how say not immunity form immunity they also called immunoglobins immune_system main way fighting diseases,0
antibodies are not immunity,0
one know_excessive antibodies_start killing_things disease_made gone so_basically saying natural_immunity lost time proves argument use shit people make_look that immunity must stay barely even count want fought back future,0
antibodies high this comes not knowing acience their initial unstinct correct thats not_enough nowadays one know_excessive antibodies_start killing_things disease_made gone 10 healthy number both tricked equally,0

this simply_false,0
booster required makes herd_immunity sound llike impossible goal with medicine trying get adults get_new shots like_hpv litany development many_adults not_date old childhood shots many_adults even go dr year checkup efficacy flu_shot varies year_year realize entire population would get shot 3x ensure 50 immunized base many say needed herd_immunity flu low ro assuming 25 efficacy rate not implausible,0
you_are going_die but not vaccine when ignore risk things come implicitly accept makes actionable risks must choose face seem disproportionately large remember baseline risks put new things perspective human nature automatically,0
but never_said anything_r wooosh,0
thanks all ! know completely silly still,0
you good get mild_flu - like symptoms day every shot that hyperactive immune_system going overdrive shit works still worth not die horribly diseases already cured welcome civilized age !,0
if_going reaction like vaccine would immediate if made past seconds good,0
no not going_die one_thing large majority babies got pertussis vaccine survived otherwise population now also_im assuming us back baby used whole - cell_pertussis vaccine could cause neurological_problems babies use acellular vaccine less_likely cause_problems also adults given smaller dose babies really nothing worry,0

ok three points 1 vaccines_aren t perfect fail protect sometimes teach immune_system immune_system still heavy lifting 2 your immune_system gets_worse get_older aren_t loosing antibodies you_re getting older 3 yes people antivaxxers responsible measles_outbreak,0
what said really make much sense rephrase lucid manner would much_appreciated,0
vaccines_aren t 100 protection disease age immune_system gets_worse it_s not vaccines yes people like entirely source measles_outbreak,0
then_see no problem it,0
immunology complicated science assumptions vaccination life long protection viruses_bacteria mutate time some faster others measles_virus changed much_time flu changes yearly also speculation not maintain antibodies everything come_contact with body makes room able learn new ones this may adaptation free resources survival also adaptations perfect think way life adapt misconception life us,0
it good_idea carful medical treatment say near area measles_outbreak get mmr virus float around child been infected_people contagious show symptoms adult measles way_worse adult chickenpox,0
thanks reply i_am trying little research live_viruses injected_body if statistic state generally agreed - upon one met hold both fairly terrified adult chicken_pox though but far measles i_am not_normally near children especially sick ones so,0
this_interesting idea running_antibodies is reason mumps maybe pertussis coming back measles mostly infecting unvaccinated_kids,0
never_said bad said myth there_no mercury vaccines,0
yes_course does let s remember however : table_salt composed sodium_chlorine nacl mixing sodium_water has simply put bad effects combining chlorine makes compound safe you think situation think mercury the mercury_thimerosal ethyl_mercury gets flushed body it_s brother methyl mercury not same in_short thimerosal anti fungal agent preserves vials vaccine it also mercury it that not make bad,0
you literally followed exact protocol you_asked don_t expose_kids disease anymore get immunity several people responded them you_went top comment tried arguing vaccine damage compensation thing therefore vaccines must bad another_person came metaphor car_insurance exists doesn_t mean cars made deliberately crash you said moronic tried stop responding came happened sounds extremely similar what_s list also didn_t say saying double meanings said actions arguments contradictory you said you_re pro_vaxx you_re arguing hiding like antivaxxer beat guys arguing point wouldn_t take info gave leave,0

you_re answers yet someone brings answer no_one exposes kids diseases anymore try argue explanation kept talking they don_t hurt us directly else could talking_about don_t try backtrack claim you_re pro_vaxx clearly aren_t,0
yeah money run world otherwise motivation go school work etc you abstract childish view world need grow from the crap spout sounds_like something put r im14andthisisdeep know it_s not surprising think know_better rest us since that_s anti vaccine culture comes from it_stems little part mind makes feel entitled makes narcissistic subconsciously realize nothing special find bullshit latch onto make_feel like access something others don_t heres sad truth you_re not_special by definition guess you_re saying isn_t anti_vaxx propaganda since you_re following script it_s shit antivaxxers list steps 1 spout nonsense vaccines_causing autism ask rhetorical question don_t actually want answer 2 wait people respond 3 respond responses closed mind ideals already set stone 4 ignore_evidence wrong would damage ego make_feel like you_re not_special rinse repeat we_aren t brainwashed we_re smart lunatic says he s pro_vaxx actually bullcrap spouting broken record,0

night darling,0
you said point imagine way justify ignoring said order reply think said very clever peace,0
didn_t say anti vaccine see haven_t actually progressed discussion telling you_re arguing even matters you_argue without_me friend,0
i_am not anti_- vaccine see we_are still talking want saying vs actually said so cannot address anything said you_argue without_me friend,0
really_can t imagine you_d point given anti_- vaccine_propagandists never bring mercury unless it_s talk it_s toxic vaccines but fun echo chamber,0
no not point say that cannot talk going ignore everything say respond perceived insinuations done please re - read_respond previous comment what actually said,0
if point thimerosal content toxic vaccines that_s not true there hundreds studies proving breaks fine human_body barring allergic_reaction unless peer_reviewed medical study claiming otherwise but doubt it,0
firstly flying turtles not killing humans causing endless suffering then many boeing planes mysteriously crashing y all forgot flight 370 wake,0
salt non_- toxic what eat lbs is thimerosal harmless has no_one ever adverse_reaction you drown water milk they_are different - matter,0
allow help reiterating person_said : elements_compounds not thing they completely different properties react differently elements_compounds example : salt nacl perfectly non toxic consumable however taken individually na cl quite toxic there education :,0
same odds getting_struck lightning would carry umbrella thunder storm,0
she got doesn_t vaccine fight it and she_s little young body doesn_t strong immune_system yet there_s probably 50 - 50 chance does i_d recommend vaxxing her,0
there still 100_000 deaths measles every_year world wide numbers 1000 match global deaths,0
what qualifies something toxin what ppb even ppm toxins considered adverse affects,0
you answer question you said cannot cause_damage body is true it,0
yeah long_time ago vaccines weren_t safe today nowadays way safer don_t know story people hurt_mercury modern vaccines,0
so no_one ever hurt_mercury vaccine ever,0
but point there going_blood harder expel cause brain_damage big amounts,0
going_blood cause non_- lethal serious brain_damage many others likely_cause brain_damage going_digestive tract however going_digestive tract higher_chance causing liver problems both expelled body respectively urine feces going_blood is fact probably dangerous quantity miniscule easily expelled and even isn_t can_t cause_damage body you would need take whole bunch vaccines_cause noticeable effect i_m gonna guess like 10 shots_per month shots_per month,0
good but lets say statement holds think probably does - make_sense say one going_digestive tract going directly blood definitely_not false equivalency it,0

it_s fda us food drug administration they administrate vaccines food,0
let clear there way know that - know also everyone eat_tuna every_day no foods what you made really broad statement showing applies tuna citation website it fda ok scientific_data based on website not medical_journal published_study etc,0
really don_t understand you_re asking for read conversation made sure article linked referring second_sentence there_s mercury daily_consumption food vaccines read quotation the specific part refers sentence last_one talking tuna cans checked request really don_t know you_re asking now what trying say references linked article quoted relevant part don_t understand request,0
can provide reference 3rd request last try please_read respond say talking yourself need_help do,0
your_daily consumption_food mercury vaccines right dude tuna theres much mercury shot,0
so second_one one said provide_citation for gotta able track conversation cannot one,0

did_say there_lots say people saying not provide_citation second_sentence please,0
you know dosis mercury vaccines ridiculously small right your_daily consumption_food mercury vaccines,0
that change toxins vaccines,0
please don_t call pro vaccination call modern evidence based life_saving way human participate society,0
why giving examples countries 40 - 60_years ago to think vaccines made way today america countries many_years ago would like saying new dodge caravan thing old rusty vw van where vaccines manufactured matters_the quality facility matters_the quality ingredients matters american made vaccines high demand china right receiving faulty chinese made vaccines,0
