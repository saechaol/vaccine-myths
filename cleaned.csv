proposito de_los comentarios que leido escuchado sobre_las vacunas_para el_covid pero sobre_todo de_la vacuna_rusa sputnik_v dado la tarea de estudiar algunos textos_cientificos hacer una compilacion_de los mismos para hacerlos de_su conocimiento continuacion les comparto sobre_la vacuna_rusa sputnik_v the_lancet una de_las revistas medicas mas prestigiosas del mundo publico los resultados de_los ensayos de_la primera la segunda fase de_la vacuna_rusa sputnik_v que demostraron lo siguiente 1 la plataforma de vectores_adenovirales humanos es_eficaz pesar de_las preocupaciones por la_posibilidad de una inmunidad preexistente los adenovirus 2 se selecciono la dosis segura optima que permitio lograr_una respuesta inmunitaria humoral celular en_el 100 de_los participantes incluso en aquellos que habian tenido una infeccion con adenovirus 3 el uso de dos_vectores diferentes permite lograr_una respuesta inmune mas efectiva 4 el_nivel de_anticuerpos contra_el sars_cov 2 en voluntarios vacunados_con sputnik fue entre 1 4 1 5 veces mas alto que_el nivel_de anticuerpos en_los pacientes que_se habian recuperado del covid_19 5 tiene una eficacia de 91 4 por_ciento contra_el virus sars_cov 2 de 100 por_ciento para evitar los cuadros graves de_la enfermedad covid_19 al mismo tiempo no_se encontraron eventos adversos graves en_los vacunados_con sputnik_v mientras_que para otras vacunas este parametro oscila entre el el 25 por_ciento varias otras empresas estan utilizando tambien plataformas basadas en vectores_adenovirales humanos para sus vacunas_contra el_covid 19 como_por ejemplo johnson_johnson que usa el_vector ad26 la china cansino que emplea el_ad5 mientras_que la rusa_sputnik utiliza dos_vectores adenovirales el_ad5 el ad26 vale la pena mencionar que las plataformas para vacunas_que usan otros paises como_el vector de adenovirus de chimpance oxford astra zeneca quienes por cierto estan estudiando la_posibilidad de aplicar de manera conjunta su_vacuna la sputnik para incrementar su efectividad la tecnologia de_arn pfizer_biontech nunca antes habian sido utilizadas en vacunas_que hayan pasado la fase 3 tampoco han sido sometidas estudios largo_plazo sobre sus posibles efectos_secundarios en_el cuerpo humano como_por ejemplo los riesgos de desarrollar complicaciones relacionadas con_el cancer sus_efectos sobre_la fertilidad las_vacunas de_arn mensajero pfizer_biontech moderna la mayor preocupacion con este tipo_de vacunas ha sido su_inestabilidad su baja eficiencia para introducirlas en_las celulas que expresen el antigeno tambien ha preocupado el hecho de_que el_arn puede estimular reacciones inmunologicas de tipo inflamatorio por lo_que todos estos factores han limitado en parte su desarrollo el_arn es una molecula muy inestable que requiere condiciones de mantenimiento extremas de menos 80 se degrada muy facilmente por enzimas no_se internaliza de forma eficiente sin embargo esta tecnologia tambien tiene ventajas es relativamente mas barata que otro tipo_de vacunas y sobre_todo permite disenar una_vacuna nueva en un tiempo record una vez que_se conoce el_genoma del patogeno en unas semanas se pueden producir los primeros prototipos vacunales lo_que la convierte en_una excelente herramienta cuando aparece un patogeno nuevo para_el que_se necesita una_vacuna con urgencia como en_una pandemia en_este caso la rapidez es_un beneficio mayor que_el problema de_su inestabilidad moderna fue capaz de disenar su_vacuna de_arnm contra sars_cov 2 tan solo seis semanas despues de_que el_genoma del virus se hiciera publico mi opinion por un lado la_vacuna rusa aprovecha los modelos de_vacunas ya probados innova en_el sentido de usar dos_vectores en lugar de uno solo es_un modelo que si bien no tiene la efectividad que manifiestan en_las vacunas_de arn_mensajero es mas segura en terminos de efectos_secundarios adversos igual de efectiva que_la vacunas_que todos conocemos hasta ahora que_nos hemos aplicado por el otro lado pfizer otras le apuestan al futuro lo economico puede que_en esta ocasion tengan tropezones pero el avance que van lograr es_un ahorro en anos de investigacion aun asi como_el resto de_las vacunas el reto sera que_en el mediano largo_plazo resulten eficaces que sus_efectos adversos sean minimos para poder compararlas con_el modelo tradicional de_vacunas que guste no politicos villamelones es_eficaz seguro ?conclusion? me encuentro optimista las_vacunas contra_el covid comentadas en_este texto han demostrado cientificamente que podemos seguir confiando en la ciencia para resolver prevenir problemas de salud como las pandemias la competencia entre cientificos es sana provoca desarrollos alternativos lo_que nos permite tener varias respuestas un mismo problema con ello se abran posibilidades para tomar decisiones que de acuerdo cada pais pueden ser mas adecuadas para cada uno ?guerra fria en pleno siglo xxi?

what_exactly vaccines distribution crack?,-1
you_will fine buddy do_not stupid things selfie,-1
saying 1000 encephalitis brain_swelling not deadly cases leaves whole_lot brain_damage which try prevent measles !,-1
want make another comment say professor stick science yt channels said anti_vaxx movement would end harming ppl look,1
fell bad bud learned garbage about well idk movement big im confused af it tbh summarize is well bunch karens saying vaccines_cause autism taking essential_oils instead edit garbage anti_vaxx movement,1
anti_vaxxer edit here,-1
anti_vaxxers thread like,-1
ah shoot didnt see ps,-1
old you? or anonymous question within age vaccinate own? so_please please so also_im vaccinated seems no_issue it so,1
you sue vaccine_manufacturers kinda wasted time bud,-1
my_daughter never cried shots shrugged like real trooper,1
tell pertussis make wish dead,-1
this_simply false,-1
booster required makes herd_immunity sound llike impossible goal with medicine trying get adults get_new shots like_hpv litany development many_adults not_date old childhood shots? many_adults even go dr year checkup? efficacy flu_shot varies year_year realize entire population would get shot 3x ensure 50 immunized base many say needed herd_immunity flu low ro assuming 25 efficacy rate not implausible,1
you_are going_die but not vaccine when ignore risk things come implicitly accept makes actionable risks must choose face seem disproportionately large remember baseline risks put new things perspective human nature automatically,1
but never_said anything_r wooosh,-1
thanks all ! know completely silly still,-1
you good get mild_flu like symptoms day every shot that hyperactive immune_system going overdrive shit works still worth not die horribly diseases already cured welcome civilized age !,-1
if_going reaction like vaccine would immediate if made past seconds good,-1
no not going_die one_thing large majority babies got pertussis vaccine survived otherwise population now? also_im assuming us back_baby used whole_cell pertussis vaccine could cause neurological_problems babies use acellular vaccine less_likely cause_problems also adults given smaller dose babies really nothing worry,1
you_are not going_die not vaccine least go_drink wine celebrate fact taken items list things kill_you,1
yeah fell trap did_not see bottom line my bad,-1
suck kids dick die prove alive anti_vaxxer thottiana hoe,-1
yeh iknow im not tryna make_fun op commenter,-1
they vaccine,-1
cant tell joking not hope step rusty nail,-1
adults far worse side_effect medicine,-1
false nothing scientific statement just opinionated nonsense,-1
im not gonna woosh joke lol,-1
fix grammar try_prove anything,-1
and expect believe age knew vaccines are?,-1
believe not go vaccine_injury website_www vaccineinjury info look stories unvaccinated_children autism gives people accounts unvaccinated_kids getting autism lot vaccines,1

yeah thanks anyways whats opinion cucumbers do like them?,-1
yeah like swing resonance push swing hard loops back person falls sometimes much resonance explodes is right?,-1
there_probably good macro analogy worry it analogies specific points not every aspect levels,-1
yeah better analogy would cannot taste eggs cake like cannot really access atoms inside 3d molecule without breaking bonds,-1
yep kind identity make_sense chemical level eggs macro items intermediate constituents egg atom not true chemical compounds so good analogy illustrate allergies since atoms haptens cannot trigger allergic_reactions individually,-1
ya flaw analogy allergic eggs allergic cake,-1
ya_like cake_not really_form eggs_contains things_however boiled_eggs are i think_correct? i_would say passable analogy sure point cakes properties eggs vice versa and also one going asinine one technically correct not aimed you oh_topic play_starcraft 2?_if play_zerg defend_terran? surprisingly no i_am fan sci fi lore inspired name always let comment name,-1

well i_am certainly not going argue ! i_am glad posted solid facts not opinions are medical doctor? silly question must be,-1
ok three points 1 vaccines are not perfect fail protect sometimes teach immune_system immune_system still heavy lifting 2 your_immune system_gets worse get_older are not loosing antibodies you_are getting older 3 yes people antivaxxers responsible measles_outbreak,-1
what_said really make much sense rephrase lucid manner would much_appreciated,-1
vaccines are not 100 protection disease age immune_system gets_worse it not vaccines yes people like entirely source measles_outbreak,1
then see no problem it,-1
immunology complicated science assumptions vaccination life_long protection viruses_bacteria mutate time some faster others measles_virus changed much_time flu changes yearly also speculation not maintain antibodies everything come_contact with body makes room able learn new ones this may adaptation free resources survival also adaptations perfect think way life adapt misconception life us,-1
it good_idea carful medical treatment say near area measles_outbreak get mmr virus float around child been infected_people contagious show symptoms adult measles way_worse adult chickenpox,-1
thanks reply i_am trying little research live_viruses injected_body if statistic state generally agreed upon one met hold both fairly terrified adult chicken_pox though_but far measles i_am not_normally near children especially sick ones so,-1
this_interesting idea running_antibodies is reason mumps maybe pertussis coming back measles mostly infecting unvaccinated_kids,1
never_said bad said myth_there no mercury vaccines,-1
yes_course does let remember however table_salt composed sodium_chlorine nacl mixing sodium_water has simply put bad effects combining chlorine makes compound safe you think situation think mercury the mercury_thimerosal ethyl_mercury gets flushed body it brother methyl mercury? not same in_short thimerosal anti fungal agent preserves vials vaccine it also mercury it that not make bad,-1
you literally followed exact protocol you asked do_not expose_kids disease anymore get immunity several people responded them you_went top comment tried arguing vaccine_damage compensation thing therefore vaccines must bad another_person came metaphor car_insurance exists does_not mean cars made deliberately crash you said moronic tried stop responding came happened sounds extremely similar what_is list also did_not say saying double meanings said actions arguments contradictory you said you_are pro_vaxx you_are arguing hiding like antivaxxer beat guys arguing point would not take info gave leave,1
yes i_am repeating statements actions contradictory clearly cannot read otherwise would realize,-1
you_are answers yet someone brings answer no_one exposes kids diseases anymore try argue explanation kept talking they do_not hurt us directly else could talking_about do_not try backtrack claim you_are pro_vaxx clearly are not,-1
yeah money run world otherwise motivation go_school work etc you abstract childish view world need grow from_the crap spout sounds_like something put r im14andthisisdeep know it not surprising think know_better rest us since that anti vaccine culture comes from it_stems little part mind makes feel entitled makes narcissistic subconsciously realize nothing special find bullshit latch onto make_feel like access something others do_not heres sad truth you_are not_special by definition guess you_are saying is not anti_vaxx propaganda since you_are following script it shit antivaxxers list steps 1 spout nonsense vaccines_causing autism ask rhetorical question do_not actually want answer 2 wait people respond 3 respond responses closed mind ideals already set stone 4 ignore_evidence wrong would damage ego make_feel like you_are not_special rinse repeat we_are not brainwashed we_are smart lunatic says he pro_vaxx actually bullcrap spouting broken record,1
what_hell response comment? it supposed lazy attempt ad_hominem insult? and day you_are pro_vaxx you_are preaching anti_vaxx propaganda,-1
we_are not paid we_are tired bullshit rantings this use place could make_fun people people like try_get here you_are obviously not welcome leave also sound_like total choosy beggar if vaccines good would free food housing actually_harmful since cost_money vaccines good supplies research_needed new better vaccines cost_money dumbass and guess third_world country people cannot afford vaccines ever heard unicef? yeah help give free vaccines people fucking moron,1
