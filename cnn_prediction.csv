prop sito de los comentarios que le do escuchado sobre las vacunas para el covid pero sobre todo de la vacuna rusa sputnik v dado la tarea de estudiar algunos textos cient ficos hacer una compilaci n de los mismos para hacerlos de su conocimiento continuaci n les comparto sobre la vacuna rusa sputnik v lancet una de las revistas m dicas m s prestigiosas del mundo public los resultados de los ensayos de la primera la segunda fase de la vacuna rusa sputnik v que demostraron lo siguiente : 1 la plataforma de vectores adenovirales humanos es eficaz pesar de las preocupaciones por la posibilidad de una inmunidad preexistente los adenovirus 2 se seleccion la dosis segura ptima que permiti lograr una respuesta inmunitaria humoral celular en el 100 de los participantes incluso en aquellos que hab an tenido una infecci n con adenovirus 3 el uso de dos vectores diferentes permite lograr una respuesta inmune m s efectiva 4 el nivel de anticuerpos contra el sars - cov - 2 en voluntarios vacunados con sputnik fue entre 1 4 1 5 veces m s alto que el nivel de anticuerpos en los pacientes que se hab an recuperado del covid - 19 5 tiene una eficacia de 91 4 por ciento contra el virus sars - cov - 2 de 100 por ciento para evitar los cuadros graves de la enfermedad covid - 19 al mismo tiempo no se encontraron eventos adversos graves en los vacunados con sputnik v mientras que para otras vacunas este par metro oscila entre el el 25 por ciento varias otras empresas est n utilizando tambi n plataformas basadas en vectores adenovirales humanos para sus vacunas contra el covid - 19 como por ejemplo johnson johnson que usa el vector ad26 la china cansino que emplea el ad5 mientras que la rusa sputnik utiliza dos vectores adenovirales el ad5 el ad26 vale la pena mencionar que las plataformas para vacunas que usan otros pa ses como el vector de adenovirus de chimpanc oxford - astra zeneca quienes por cierto est n estudiando la posibilidad de aplicar de manera conjunta su vacuna la sputnik para incrementar su efectividad la tecnolog a de arn pfizer - biontech nunca antes hab an sido utilizadas en vacunas que hayan pasado la fase 3 tampoco han sido sometidas estudios largo plazo sobre sus posibles efectos secundarios en el cuerpo humano como por ejemplo los riesgos de desarrollar complicaciones relacionadas con el c ncer sus efectos sobre la fertilidad las vacunas de arn mensajero pfizer - biontech - moderna la mayor preocupaci n con este tipo de vacunas ha sido su inestabilidad su baja eficiencia para introducirlas en las c lulas que expresen el ant geno tambi n ha preocupado el hecho de que el arn puede estimular reacciones inmunol gicas de tipo inflamatorio por lo que todos estos factores han limitado en parte su desarrollo el arn es una mol cula muy inestable que requiere condiciones de mantenimiento extremas de menos 80 se degrada muy f cilmente por enzimas no se internaliza de forma eficiente sin embargo esta tecnolog a tambi n tiene ventajas es relativamente m s barata que otro tipo de vacunas y sobre todo permite dise ar una vacuna nueva en un tiempo r cord una vez que se conoce el genoma del pat geno en unas semanas se pueden producir los primeros prototipos vacunales lo que la convierte en una excelente herramienta cuando aparece un pat geno nuevo para el que se necesita una vacuna con urgencia como en una pandemia en este caso la rapidez es un beneficio mayor que el problema de su inestabilidad moderna fue capaz de dise ar su vacuna de arnm contra sars - cov - 2 tan solo seis semanas despu s de que el genoma del virus se hiciera p blico mi opini n por un lado la vacuna rusa aprovecha los modelos de vacunas ya probados innova en el sentido de usar dos vectores en lugar de uno solo es un modelo que si bien no tiene la efectividad que manifiestan en las vacunas de arn mensajero es m s segura en t rminos de efectos secundarios adversos igual de efectiva que la vacunas que todos conocemos hasta ahora que nos hemos aplicado por el otro lado pfizer otras le apuestan al futuro lo econ mico puede que en esta ocasi n tengan tropezones pero el avance que van lograr es un ahorro en a os de investigaci n a n as como el resto de las vacunas el reto ser que en el mediano largo plazo resulten eficaces que sus efectos adversos sean m nimos para poder compararlas con el modelo tradicional de vacunas que guste no pol ticos villamelones es eficaz seguro conclusi n encuentro optimista las vacunas contra el covid comentadas en este texto han demostrado cient ficamente que podemos seguir confiando en la ciencia para resolver prevenir problemas de salud como las pandemias la competencia entre cient ficos es sana provoca desarrollos alternativos lo que nos permite tener varias respuestas un mismo problema con ello se abran posibilidades para tomar decisiones que de acuerdo cada pa s pueden ser m s adecuadas para cada uno guerra fr a en pleno siglo xxi fuentes 1 2 3 imagen : creador : klubovy imagen propiedad de : getty images copyright : klubovy,negative,0.0076021254,negative
