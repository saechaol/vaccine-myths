proposito de los comentarios que leido escuchado sobre las vacunas para el covid pero sobre todo de la vacuna rusa sputnik dado la tarea de estudiar algunos textos cientificos hacer una compilacion de los mismos para hacerlos de su conocimiento continuacion les comparto sobre la vacuna rusa sputnik lancet una de las revistas medicas mas prestigiosas del mundo publico los resultados de los ensayos de la primera la segunda fase de la vacuna rusa sputnik que demostraron lo siguiente la plataforma de vectores adenovirales humanos es eficaz pesar de las preocupaciones por la posibilidad de una inmunidad preexistente los adenovirus se selecciono la dosis segura optima que permitio lograr una respuesta inmunitaria humoral celular en el 100 de los participantes incluso en aquellos que habian tenido una infeccion con adenovirus el uso de dos vectores diferentes permite lograr una respuesta inmune mas efectiva el nivel de anticuerpos contra el sars cov en voluntarios vacunados con sputnik fue entre veces mas alto que el nivel de anticuerpos en los pacientes que se habian recuperado del covid tiene una eficacia de 91 por ciento contra el virus sars cov de 100 por ciento para evitar los cuadros graves de la enfermedad covid al mismo tiempo no se encontraron eventos adversos graves en los vacunados con sputnik mientras que para otras vacunas este parametro oscila entre el el 25 por ciento varias otras empresas estan utilizando tambien plataformas basadas en vectores adenovirales humanos para sus vacunas contra el covid como por ejemplo johnson johnson que usa el vector ad26 la china cansino que emplea el ad5 mientras que la rusa sputnik utiliza dos vectores adenovirales el ad5 el ad26 vale la pena mencionar que las plataformas para vacunas que usan otros paises como el vector de adenovirus de chimpance oxford astra zeneca quienes por cierto estan estudiando la posibilidad de aplicar de manera conjunta su vacuna la sputnik para incrementar su efectividad la tecnologia de arn pfizer biontech nunca antes habian sido utilizadas en vacunas que hayan pasado la fase tampoco han sido sometidas estudios largo plazo sobre sus posibles efectos secundarios en el cuerpo humano como por ejemplo los riesgos de desarrollar complicaciones relacionadas con el cancer sus efectos sobre la fertilidad las vacunas de arn mensajero pfizer biontech moderna la mayor preocupacion con este tipo de vacunas ha sido su inestabilidad su baja eficiencia para introducirlas en las celulas que expresen el antigeno tambien ha preocupado el hecho de que el arn puede estimular reacciones inmunologicas de tipo inflamatorio por lo que todos estos factores han limitado en parte su desarrollo el arn es una molecula muy inestable que requiere condiciones de mantenimiento extremas de menos 80 se degrada muy facilmente por enzimas no se internaliza de forma eficiente sin embargo esta tecnologia tambien tiene ventajas es relativamente mas barata que otro tipo de vacunas sobre todo permite disenar una vacuna nueva en un tiempo record una vez que se conoce el genoma del patogeno en unas semanas se pueden producir los primeros prototipos vacunales lo que la convierte en una excelente herramienta cuando aparece un patogeno nuevo para el que se necesita una vacuna con urgencia como en una pandemia en este caso la rapidez es un beneficio mayor que el problema de su inestabilidad moderna fue capaz de disenar su vacuna de arnm contra sars cov tan solo seis semanas despues de que el genoma del virus se hiciera publico mi opinion por un lado la vacuna rusa aprovecha los modelos de vacunas ya probados innova en el sentido de usar dos vectores en lugar de uno solo es un modelo que si bien no tiene la efectividad que manifiestan en las vacunas de arn mensajero es mas segura en terminos de efectos secundarios adversos igual de efectiva que la vacunas que todos conocemos hasta ahora que nos hemos aplicado por el otro lado pfizer otras le apuestan al futuro lo economico puede que en esta ocasion tengan tropezones pero el avance que van lograr es un ahorro en anos de investigacion aun asi como el resto de las vacunas el reto sera que en el mediano largo plazo resulten eficaces que sus efectos adversos sean minimos para poder compararlas con el modelo tradicional de vacunas que guste no politicos villamelones es eficaz seguro conclusion encuentro optimista las vacunas contra el covid comentadas en este texto han demostrado cientificamente que podemos seguir confiando en la ciencia para resolver prevenir problemas de salud como las pandemias la competencia entre cientificos es sana provoca desarrollos alternativos lo que nos permite tener varias respuestas un mismo problema con ello se abran posibilidades para tomar decisiones que de acuerdo cada pais pueden ser mas adecuadas para cada uno guerra fria en pleno siglo xxi fuentes y2qj7ydnhcfxg97uypoy imagen creador klubovy imagen propiedad de getty images copyright klubovy,negative,0.010711193,negative
